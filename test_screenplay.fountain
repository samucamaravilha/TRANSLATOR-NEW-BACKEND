>FADE IN:

.**INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT** #1#

The fluorescent lights flicker. The room is empty except for DETECTIVE SARAH COLE, 40s, sharp eyes, tired face. She stares at a case board covered in photos and red string.

COLE
(to herself)
Something doesn't add up.

She picks up her phone and dials. It rings twice.

.**INT. MARCUS'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME** #2#

MARCUS, 30s, nervous energy, paces the room. His phone buzzes on the table. He hesitates before answering.

MARCUS
Yeah?

COLE (V.O.)
Marcus. It's Cole. We need to talk.

MARCUS
(whispering)
How did you get this number?

COLE (V.O.)
That's not important right now. I found something. Something that changes everything.

A long silence. Marcus stops pacing.

MARCUS
Where do you want to meet?

.**INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS** #3#

Cole looks at the board one last time.

COLE
The old warehouse on Fifth. Midnight.

She hangs up and grabs her coat.

>FADE OUT.
