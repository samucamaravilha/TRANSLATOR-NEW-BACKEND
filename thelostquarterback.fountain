**EPISODE 1**

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - DAY** #1#

Festive banners repping the LA GOLDEN KNIGHTS decorate the walls of the store. A crowd of FANS/REPORTERS are gathered before NFL QUARTERBACK TRENT BRADSHAW (40s, blonde). Beside him, his wife KRISTA (30s) radiates beauty in a luxurious dress.

The couple pose with TWO KIDS, ASHER (5, blonde), wearing his dad's jersey "Bradshaw #14" and ISABELLA (7, blonde). Cameras FLASH throughout his speech -- a picture perfect family.

TRENT
As an NFL Quarterback for nearly two decades, I know the importance of family, whether on the field or at home. So, I'm honored to be up here, with my gorgeous wife and kids, to celebrate the grand opening of *Bradshaw Sporting Goods!*

OFF-SCREEN the fans CHEER and form a line, while Trent and Krista take their seats behind a table. The kids squirm free.

YOUNG ISABELLA
Mom, we're borrrrred!

KRISTA
You're *borrrred*? Well, your dad has a lot of autographs to get through. You two go play. But, hey, make sure you watch your brother.
(to Asher)
And Asher, be good for your sister.

YOUNG ASHER YOUNG ISABELLA
We promise. We promise.

DONNY LEWIS (mid 30s, dirty orange construction vest) limps up to the line gawking at Trent with a crazed look. His son, WYATT (5, brunette), wears the same "Bradshaw #14" jersey as Asher,\*\* watches Isabella and Asher race by playing tag.

YOUNG WYATT
Dad, can I go play too?

DONNY
*Play*? Wyatt, I told you, that's Trent Bradshaw, 5 times Super Bowl champion, a living legend! He's everything I should've been if it wasn't for this damn knee...

DONNY
(a devious smile)
But that's all gonna change with you, I'm gonna make sure he sees you, trains you, you'll be the next champion and we'll make it big!

Just then, Asher sprints past LAUGHING. He trips and crashes, skidding his knee. Isabella runs up to comfort him.

YOUNG ASHER
(in pain)
Don't worry, it's just a scratch.

YOUNG ISABELLA
You're bleeding, Asher! Stay here, I'll get you a Band-Aid. I won't let anything happen to you.

YOUNG ASHER
You're the best big sister ever!

ANGLE ON THE BACK OF THE CENTER as an ELECTRICAL BOX starts to spark, a small stream of smoke slithering from it...

Isabella hugs Asher before she hurries off. Behind Asher, smoke builds and the CRACKLE of a fire is heard.

AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE, Donny limps up to Trent with an unnerving smile. With his dad distracted, Wyatt slips away.

DONNY
I'm your number one fan, Mr. Bradshaw! You don't know what this means to me --

Suddenly, an ALARM RINGS as smoke thickens.

MAN (O.S.)
FIRE!!!

The FANS SCREAM and swarm in every direction. Isabella dodges through bodies, running up to an alarmed Trent and Krista.

TRENT
Isabella, where's your brother?

YOUNG ISABELLA
In the back!

Trent looks from Isabella and Krista to the back of the store.

KRISTA
Don't worry about us, just save Asher, save our little boy!

Trent heroically hops the table and heads towards the rear. A desperate Donny grabs on to Trent as he passes.

DONNY
NO, WAIT!  I DESERVE THIS!!!

TRENT
Out of my way!
(calling out)
ASHER!!! SON!!!

Trent shoves past Donny and scans the room -- the horror. Feet stampede. PEOPLE are knocked over. Balls are scattered from toppling displays.

Trent battles the smoke to get to Asher as the ROARING sound of FLAMES mix with AGONIZING SCREAMS.

TRENT
Asher! I'm coming, son! I'm coming!

Asher, alone IN THE AISLE, chokes on the smoke. The BUILDING GROANS as the supports weaken -- it's going to collapse!

YOUNG ASHER
(hoarsely)
DAD!

CRACK!  Asher looks up as a wooden beam falls. He tries to move, but the beam topples right on his little body.

**EPISODE 2**

.**INT. HOSPITAL, LOBBY - DAY** #2#

Bandaged patients. Bloodied gurneys. SCREAMING. CRYING. Trent rushes past VICTIMS and NURSES with Isabella and Krista by his side. He scans the room for Asher, but spots a DOCTOR.

TRENT
They told me they brought my son here. Asher Bradshaw, he's five, wearing my jersey --

KRISTA
And he has a scar, on shoulder!

DOCTOR
A boy in a green jersey was just admitted to room 309 down the hall --

Trent charges off with Krista and Isabella racing behind.

.**INT. HOSPITAL, ROOM 309 - DAY** #3#

The family bursts in to find a boy in a green football jersey alone and unconscious, connected to an IV drip.

Trent walks up to the boy and reaches out with shaking hands. The boy's face comes into view: IT'S WYATT.

KRISTA
No... No, this isn't our son!

TRENT
Where is he?!? Where's Asher!

Krista sags as if her legs can't hold her up. Isabella is crying.

KRISTA
Trent, you don't think Asher's --

TRENT
No! Don't give up hope, Krista, we'll find him.

YOUNG ISABELLA
I'm scared, Mommy.

KRISTA
(pulling her close)
I know, baby. So am I.

TRENT
You two stay here, I'll make better time searching without you.

As Trent darts towards the door, Krista calls out:

KRISTA
You bring our boy home, Trent.

.**INT. HOSPITAL, LOBBY - DAY** #4#

Donny limps through the halls with obsessive eyes.

DONNY
(internal voice)
*With Trent here I still have a chance to corner him. I just need to find Wyatt first!*

He catches sight of A BOY IN A GREEN JERSEY LAYING limp on a bed in Room 300, and hobbles through the door.

.**INT. HOSPITAL, ROOM 300 - DAY** #5#

The boy lays dazedly with a bandaged gash on his head.

DONNY
Wyatt, get up, we need to get you in front of Trent --

Donny turns the boy, revealing he's... ASHER.

DONNY
Wait, you're Trent Bradshaw's son.
Holy shit. This...
  
(a manic smile grows)
Is perfect! If Trent thinks I saved you, he'd do whatever I ask! Come on, let's get you to your dad!

Donny lifts Asher who starts to struggle and fight back. Donny reflexively STRIKES ASHER, who cries out for help...

YOUNG ASHER
Daddy!

Asher crashes to the floor, his head SMACKING with a THUD.

TRENT (O.S.)
ASHER, WHERE ARE YOU!?!

DONNY
(internal voice)
*SHIT! If Trent finds out I hit his boy, he'll end me. I can't go back to prison!!! I have to hide him!*

Donny crouches down and shoves Asher under the bed. He pulls the curtain back just as Trent sprints into the room.

TRENT
Have you seen my son --

DONNY
No, Mr. Bradshaw, it's just me.

Donny shifts awkwardly in front of the bed. Trent pushes past him, and reaches for the curtain.

TRENT
What are you hiding?

_**E**_**PISODE 3**

Trent rips back the curtain revealing an empty bed.

DONNY
I would never lie to you, Mr. \*Bradshaw, I'm your number one fan! \*I even got your number inked!

Donny flashes a **#14 tattoo on his wrist.** Trent looks at it, weirded out.

ANGLE ON ASHER, stirring under the bed, his bleary eyes barely making out his dad's shoes. He's too weak to move.

ANGLE ON THE HALLWAY as the Doctor, with Wyatt on a gurney, stops outside of Room 300. Krista and Isabella rush behind.

DOCTOR
Mr. Bradshaw, your son's in critical condition, we're prepping for surgery. But we need you to sign off and pay --

TRENT
That's not my son!

A rattled Donny recognizes the boy in the gurney as his son.

DONNY
(internal voice)
*Wyatt! My boy! There's no way I can afford a hospital bill! Unless...*

Donny looks between Trent and Wyatt, his eyes lighting up as he concocts a sinister plan.

DONNY
  
(internal voice)
*If I play this right, my son won't just be trained by Trent, but raised by him, living in the lap of luxury. The next NFL champion!*

Donny's face twists to compassionate and concerned.

DONNY
Look at him, you need to help this poor boy, after all, it was your store's fire that caused this...

Krista looks at Wyatt, eyes dark with pain and a mother's fear.

KRISTA
Trent, he's right. We should help that child.  What if it were Asher lying there?
(chokes down a cry)
I'd hope whoever found our little boy would do the same.

Trent puts an arm around her shaking shoulders.

TRENT
Okay, honey. We'll help him.

DOCTOR
He's losing a lot of blood!

TRENT
Get him into surgery. But can someone please find our son!

The exhausted Bradshaws follow the doctor and the gurney. Donny's eyes linger on his son being rolled away.

DONNY
(internal voice)
*This is for us, Wyatt.*

Alone, Donny dashes to the bed and pulls Asher out from under it. Asher wipes his eyes, groggy and confused.

YOUNG ASHER
Are you my dad?

DONNY
Yeah. I'm your dad. And your name is Wyatt. Got it, you little shit?

_**CLOSE-UP**_ **SHOT**:  The back of Asher's jersey is torn revealing a **JAGGED SCAR ON HIS SHOULDER.** Donny covers the scar as he wraps Asher in a blanket.

DONNY
Now we just gotta get you out of here without anyone seeing...

.**INT. HOSPITAL, VIP ROOM - LATER SAME DAY** #6#

Trent is pacing in front of Krista in the luxury suite.

TRENT
A whole search team and no one can find Asher. It's all my fault.

KRISTA
I let him out of my sight. What kind of mother am I?

Trent pulls her into his strong embrace.

TRENT
The best, Krista. This isn't on you, it was a freak accident that someone took advantage of.  We'll find Asher, I promise you. I will never give up.

Just then, the Doctor enters.

DOCTOR
We managed to stabilize the boy. But since we can't find his parents, we'll have to call Child Services.

Krista looks up from where she's resting her head on Trent's shoulder. Her eyes are hollow with loss and pain.

KRISTA
No. The poor boy's been through too much to be put into the system.  We'll foster him until his parents show up.

DOCTOR
You Bradshaws are saints.

ANGLE ON a numb Isabella in the corner, her tear-streaked eyes locked on a TV playing a NEWS REEL OF THE FIRE'S DESTRUCTION.

YOUNG ISABELLA
(internal voice)
*Where are you, Asher?*

_**E**_**PISODE 4**

.**INT. JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER, HOLDING CELL - DAY** #7#

**Super: 12 YEARS LATER**

Wyatt (formally Asher, 17, rugged with an athletic build) smashes to the ground. A LARGE INMATE towers over him, while a smaller BOY cowers in the corner, all in ORANGE JUMPSUITS.

LARGE INMATE
What'd you say, bitch.

WYATT
I said if you're gonna pick on him, you'll have to go through me.

Large Inmate rears back to stomp on Wyatt, but Wyatt dodges. Large Inmate grabs Wyatt's jumpsuit, YANKING HARD. Fabric RIPS, revealing **A JAGGED SCAR ON THE BACK OF WYATT'S SHOULDER!**

Large Inmate's eyes flicker to THE SCAR, stunned. Wyatt takes advantage and STRIKES BACK with a BLOW that sends Large Inmate CRASHING to the ground, unconscious.

Wyatt extends a hand to the teary-eyed Boy in the corner.

WYATT
You'll be alright, kid, I won't let anything happen to you.

Suddenly, the CELL DOOR IS THROWN OPEN by a GUARD.

GUARD
What the hell happened in here?

BOY
(points at Large Inmate)
He tripped.

GUARD
(eyes Wyatt with suspicion)
Uh-huh. Come on, Wyatt, it's your lucky day, you're being released.

.**INT. JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER, LOBBY - DAY** #8#

Donny sneers as Wyatt, now in jeans & tank top, walks in followed by the Guard. Donny tosses Wyatt an ORANGE VEST.

DONNY
Well, I hope you learned your lesson. Stealing tools from a store. That's not the kid I raised.

GUARD
It's his fifth time. When he turns 18, he'll be tried as an adult.
Make sure he stays out of trouble.

DONNY
I'm watching him round the clock from work to school to church, I just don't know what else to do.

GUARD
These punks need a firm hand, if you catch me. But, I wish you the best, you seem like a good dad.

WYATT
(muttering)
And a lousy thief.

DONNY
(laughing nervously)
See, he's always acting out.

GUARD
Don't let me see you here again, kid.

The guard walks out. As soon as the door shuts, Donny grabs Wyatt by the back of the neck and forces his head down.

DONNY
Listen, you good for nothing shit. If you tell anyone you took the fall for me, so help me god, I will bash your fucking head in. Got it?

Wyatt nods defeatedly and Donny lets go.

DONNY
Now put on that vest. We got behind at work without you, so you'll have to skip school for a few days.

WYATT
What about --

DONNY
If you bring up those goddamn football tryouts one more time, I'll knock your teeth in.

WYATT
But if I get on the team, I could maybe win a football scholarship to college and make something of myself --

DONNY
You're never gonna be anything, you stupid punk! Now let's go.

_**E**_**PISODE 5**

.**EXT. BRADSHAW MANSION - DAY** #9#

A sprawling three-story McMansion, more money than class.

LEAD DETECTIVE (O.S.)
Mr. Bradshaw, we found your son!

.**INT. BRADSHAW MANSION, DINNING ROOM - DAY** #10#

Trent SLAMS A PHOTO OF A SCAR OF A TEEN down with dismissal and looks at the LEAD DETECTIVE (30s) standing before him.

TRENT
No! How many times do I have to tell you? Asher's scar is jagged and on the back of his shoulder.

OPEN SHOT to Trent in the middle of breakfast with Krista and Isabella. Krista sighs wearily at the detective.

KRISTA
You can go.

Lead Detective exits, head hung low.  Krista looks at Trent.

KRISTA 
We can't keep doing this. It's been twelve years. If Asher was going to be found, it would have happened.

Isabella (18, cheerleader outfit) surges to her feet, teary-eyed.

ISABELLA
NO, please, Mom, we can't stop looking!

KRISTA
(voice raw)
He's my son. I loved him more than my own life. But I can't watch this family lose a bit of itself every day. We have to let him go.

Trent pulls Isabella in for a hug, gives Krista a 'not now' look.

TRENT
Don't worry, honey, I'll never stop searching for Asher until he's home.

Just then, Pierce (formally Wyatt, 17) hustles in wearing new football gear with a shining helmet. He drop into his seat.

*(Note: Unless specified otherwise, Pierce should always be in some variation of his football gear and Isabella should always be in her cheerleader uniform.)*

TRENT
Looking sharp, son! You ready for tryouts today?

PIERCE
This is gonna be a cake walk. I'll run laps around the other guys.

TRENT
That's my boy. Just remember everything I taught you.

PIERCE
(notices Isabella's tears)
You okay, sis?

ISABELLA
Yeah, give us something to cheer for!

Krista gives Pierce a kiss on the cheek as she grabs her purse.

KRISTA
Good luck, honey. Not that you'll need it. I have a school board meeting but I'll be there after to celebrate.

_**E**_**PISODE 6**

.**INT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP - DAY** #11#

Wyatt, dripping in sweat, carries lumber to his coworker HUGO (30s), who has a matching vest and a warm smile.

*(Note: Wyatt should be in his orange vest and work clothes anytime he's not at school or on the football field -- yellow hard hat added when he's actually working)*

HUGO
Uh-oh, here comes the criminal.

WYATT
Hope you like that saw, asshole, it cost me a few days off my life.

Hugo and Wyatt fist bump. Hugo sighs, shakes his head.

HUGO
Your father's a real piece of work... letting you take the fall again.
(tries to lighten the mood)
Anyway, you ready for football tryouts?

Wyatt's eyes light up, voice excited.

WYATT
Hell yeah. I've been practicing every single day...
(voice drops, face darkens)
But my dad won't let me go, too much work.

HUGO
(watches him, eyes soft)
This is your chance to get out, Wyatt. Just say the word, I can cover you.

WYATT
What? No, you can't.

HUGO
You've had it hard enough.  But this could be your way out. I'll cover your shift. And if you're back by 5, your old man won't even notice.

WYATT
Really...?

Hugo nods 'yes'. Wyatt's face is filled with pure joy and gratitude. He pulls Hugo into a tight hug.

WYATT
Thank you, Hugo. I owe you.

HUGO
Now go kick some ass, kid.

Wyatt pulls back, grins like a kid on Christmas and hurries off.

ANGLE ON DONNY, busy hammering up siding. Wyatt sneaks behind him and is almost in the clear. He bumps into a pile of wood and knocks it over with a loud CLATTER. Donny snaps around.

Wyatt slips away just in time as Donny turns around. Donny stares at the wood, suspicious, but carries on hammering.

.**INT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, LOCKER ROOM - DAY** #12#

Pierce and other FOOTBALL PLAYERS, including TYLER (17), are getting ready. Gear is sprawled out on the benches.

TYLER
What's it like to have the legendary quarterback Trent Bradshaw as your dad, Pierce?  That's like so wild, man!  You must be a football prodigy.

PIERCE
I probably could've gone straight to college ball, but my dad and I both wanted the high school experience for me.

Pierce shows off his brand new helmet, Tyler whistles.

TYLER
Damn... this helmet is like top of the line. Your old man hook you up?

PIERCE
Custom-molded --

Suddenly, Wyatt rushes in and dumps his old gym bag and accidentally brushes Pierce who is holding his new helmet.

PIERCE
Watch it, dipshit! This helmet is worth more than whatever sewer grate you crawled out of.

Wyatt turns around and comes face-to-face with Pierce.

WYATT
Who the hell are you?

_**E**_**PISODE 7**

Football players snicker and make 'oh no you didn't' expressions as Pierce glares at Wyatt.

PIERCE
Who the fuck am I?  I'm football fucking royalty!
(picks at Wyatt's orange vest)
And looking at you and your orange vest, you're a goddamn plumber!

Everybody LAUGHS, Tyler SNICKERS and nudges Pierce.

TYLER
I'm sure it's the nicest thing he's got in his closet, Pierce.

WYATT
(holds up his hands)
Chill, bro. I'm not here to make trouble.

Pierce steps into Wyatt's face.

PIERCE
Who the fuck you to telling to chill? You shouldn't even be breathing the same air as me. I'll bet you live in some run down shack on the south side. Neighbors with rats and roaches!

Wyatt stiffens, then visibly tries to shake it off.

WYATT
Look, I'm just here to play ball.

Pierce, pissed off at Wyatt's calm, slams him against a locker!

PIERCE
What makes you think you deserve the right, dirtbag?! You're nothing!

Suddenly Wyatt snaps around and pins Pierce to the locker! The other guys watch in shock.

WYATT
Touch me again and you'll have to dip into that trust fund for a new set of teeth.

Then, ASSISTANT COACH (20s) with clipboard, rushes in.

ASSISTANT COACH
LADIES, GET YOUR HAIRY ASSES DRESSED, COACH BRADSHAW IS IN THE BUILDING!

**SLOW-MO:** *Trent, in a slick tracksuit, pushes the door open. He walks in with the gravitas of NFL royalty. ANGLE ON Wyatt staring at Trent, jaw dropped, starstruck.*

WYATT
(internal voice)
*Trent Bradshaw is the coach?!? I've seen every one of his plays, he's incredible, he's my hero --*

Suddenly, Trent yanks Wyatt away from Pierce, eyes furious.

TRENT
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TO MY SON?

PIERCE
Dad, this low-life just attacked me!

Pierce nudges Tyler.

TYLER
Uh -- yeah, he just spazzed out!

Wyatt looks from Trent to Pierce, who gives a devious grin.

WYATT
(internal voice)
*Sonovabitch. This asshole is Trent Bradshaw's son?!*

Trent's eyes narrow as he LOOMS OVER Wyatt, voice disgusted.

TRENT
I can tell by the smell of you, you're used to the lawless life of the streets. But in here, you listen to *me*.

Trent snatches Wyatt's SECOND-HAND HELMET with disgust.

TRENT
What kinda bargain bin did you pull this shit out of?

Pierce smirks and takes Wyatt's helmet from Trent's hand.

PIERCE
Probably all that food stamps could get him.

TRENT
(at Wyatt, warning)
That's not going to cut it on my team. If you so much as breathe out of line, I'll make sure this is the last time you ever touch a pigskin.
(calling out to the team)
ALRIGHT, HIT THE FIELD, FELLAS.

Trent files out with the players, leaving Pierce and Wyatt.

PIERCE
If you wanna be on this team...
(snaps Wyatt's chinstrap off)
I'd suggest you learn your place.

Pierce saunters out, leaving Wyatt alone in the locker room. Wyatt looks at his broken helmet, punches the locker. BANG!

WYATT
(internal voice)
*Don't do anything stupid. Just show them what you're made of.*

Wyatt strips off his vest revealing the **JAGGED SHOULDER SCAR**.

_**E**_**PISODE 8**

.**EXT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY** #13#

A group of CHEERLEADERS are on the sidelines lead by Isabella, while Assistant Coach follows Trent around with a clipboard.

Wyatt hustles onto the field where the other Football Players and Pierce are already stretching.

*(Note: Wyatt's football gear should be DRASTICALLY worse than the other players.)*

TRENT
You're late, Wyatt, drop and give me 20 before I kick your ass out.

Pierce SNICKERS as Wyatt drops to the ground. While Wyatt does pushups, Trent paces in front of the lineup.

TRENT
Listen up! Every year we award a 50,000 dollar football scholarship to our top performing athlete. I'll be looking for speed, strength, and coordination. I made it to the NFL by beating out everyone that stood in my way.
(nodding to Pierce)
So don't just *do* your best, I need you to *be* the best!

WYATT
(internal voice)
*That scholarship is my ticket out... no more juvie and taking my dad's beatings. It's not just money... it's freedom.*

Trent BLOWS his WHISTLE.

**RAPID MONTAGE:**  Sweat dripping through burpees. Passing the ball. Cleats dig into the grass. Players are tackled.

Intensity builds to...  END MONTAGE.

ON SIDELINES, Trent leans into his assistant coach, eyes locked on Pierce and beaming like a proud father.

TRENT
SHOW THEM WHAT YOU GOT, SON!

**ON FIELD**, Pierce has the ball, he looks around and spots Wyatt in position. The WHISTLE BLOWS. Pierce dodges Wyatt with a cocky LAUGH, then throws a 15-yard pass to a RECEIVER -- a routine play. He fist pumps the air victoriously.

**ON SIDELINES**, Assistant Coach jots down notes -- *not impressed*.

ASSISTANT COACH
That was a standard pass, but I think we need a stronger arm --

TRENT
It was right on the numbers. Who's last?

**ON FIELD**, Wyatt steps into position with the ball as line backers form a barrier, among them, Pierce snarls wickedly.

PIERCE
Come on, guys, you really want this pussy on the team, making us look like a fucking fundraiser!

TYLER
Let's smear his ass on the turf!!!

The other players HOLLER in agreement.

WYATT
(internal voice)
*It's not about them, this is about your future. Now or never, don't hold back.*

_**E**_**PISODE 9**

The WHISTLE BLOWS and the linebackers, led by Pierce, charge Wyatt like a two ton human wall of muscle and rage.

Wyatt dances backwards and around, dodging the rush. He spots an open receiver, Tyler, heading for the end zone, 60 yards away. Wyatt cocks his arm when -- SMACK! He's blindsided as Pierce tackles him, just managing to make the throw!

**SLOW-MO**: \*The football soars above the turf like a rocket, spiraling into Tyler's hands. A perfect pass! SILENCE.

EVERYONE -- jocks, cheerleaders, assistant coach -- stop to watch with dropped jaws.

Then, everyone ERUPTS IN CHEERS -- Except Trent and Pierce. Pierce chucks his helmet as Assistant Coach grabs onto Trent.

ASSISTANT COACH
OH MY GOD. That was a 65-yard pass! I haven't seen anyone play like that since... well you, sir.

Trent's eyes fill with grief, face haunted as we **FLASHBACK TO:**

.**EXT. BRADSHAW MANSION, BACKYARD - DAY (FLASHBACK)** #14#

Trent (40s) tosses a football to Asher (5), barefoot in the grass. Asher catches it perfectly. He wears a tank top, the scar on his shoulder obvious.  He grins at his father.

YOUNG ASHER
That was way too easy, Dad.

TRENT
That's my boy!

Trent swoops in, tussles Asher to the ground. Asher squeals with joy.  Trent laughs. He looks at Asher, full of pride.

TRENT
I can't wait to see you play for real on the field!

Their laughter fades as we **END FLASHBACK.**

.**EXT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS** #15#

Trent tries to shake off his loss, face hardening.

TRENT
It was a lucky throw.
(calling out)
Alright, alright, LINE UP!

**TIME LEAP** -- Trent and Assistant Coach argue in a huddle as the team lines up. Pierce shoulders into Wyatt, ready to fight.

PIERCE
Like I said, learn your place, bitch. You don't belong here.

Trent turns towards his players with Assistant Coach rolling his eyes behind him. Pierce straightens up with confidence.

TRENT
A few of you really proved yourselves out there, but after careful consideration, the first string quarterback will be...

**EPISODE 10**

TRENT
Pierce Bradshaw!

PAN OVER the lineup of confused faces as we LAND ON Wyatt, slumped with disappointment. Next to him, Pierce wears a gloating smile. Trent clears his throat with reluctance.

TRENT
Backing him up as second string will be...
  
(beat, almost disgusted)
Wyatt Lewis... Shower up, practice starts on Monday.

Pierce's smile falters. Wyatt looks up, hopeful. Trent and Assistant Coach exit as the other players disburse.

WYATT
(internal voice)
*Well, it's better than nothing. And I still have a chance to prove myself and win that scholarship.*

Isabella skips over, flashing her pearly whites, shaking her pom-poms to Pierce, who looks like he's about to explode.

ISABELLA
There's our new quarterback!
(then notices Pierce's rage)
What's wrong, little brother?

PIERCE
This fucking douchebag won't admit his game was weak.

ISABELLA
I thought it was a great throw...
Everyone was saying so.

WYATT
Thank you...

Wyatt looks at Isabella. There's something familiar about her.

WYATT
(internal voice)
*Huh, do I know her...*

PIERCE
A GREAT THROW, MY ASS. He fucking cheated!

WYATT
I didn't cheat!

PIERCE
You stepped over the line of scrimmage and still threw the ball -- tell me you saw that!

Pierce snaps to Tyler, who squares up behind like a guard.

TYLER
That game was straight up dirty.
But I guess when you grow up playing street ball with the other rats, rules don't mean much.

PIERCE
*Fuck rules*, he'll probably do anything to claw his way to that scholarship. God knows he's never seen money like that before --

WYATT
(quiet, but razor-sharp)
At least I'm not a nepo-baby with an arm limper than your dick.

PIERCE
The fuck you say?!

He shoves Wyatt. Wyatt holds his ground, shoves back! Pierce is thrown easily! Realizing he's outmatched, Pierce turns to TWO LINEBACKERS, biggest mofos on team, each over 225 pounds.

PIERCE
Let's fuck him up good, boys.

Linebacker 1 cracks his knuckles, then swings at Wyatt!

_**E**_**PISODE 11**

Wyatt blocks, his whole body trembling from the strength of the hit. Fuck! He PUNCHES the Linebacker 1 -- it's like hitting a brick wall! Linebacker 1 smirks and SWINGS --

ISABELLA
Wyatt, look out!

Wyatt dodges, light on his feet, uses Linebacker 1's weight against him, causing him to crash into a charging Linebacker 2! As the two titans hit the ground, Pierce sucker punches Wyatt from behind in the kidney!

Isabella flinches as Linebacker 1 slams into Wyatt from the side! He face plants in the grass! Then Pierce, Linebacker 1 & 2 and Tyler surround Wyatt kicking him! Wyatt curls up, protecting his head.

 ISABELLA
Stop! You'll kill him!

Pierce flips Wyatt over, gets on top of Wyatt, fist drawn

back, ready to K.O. him, revealing Wyatt's shirt is torn, _**sh**_**owing part of his SCAR**!

FOOTBALLER 1 (O.C.)
Shit, Pierce, your mom's here!

ANGLE ON Krista storming across the field, face red. Pierce rolls off Wyatt, pretending to be injured, GROANING IN PAIN.

PIERCE
Mom, this freak attacked me!

TYLER
It's true, Mrs. Bradshaw, he just came at us like a rabid dog!

KRISTA
Get away from my son!

Linebackers 1 & 2 cover and nod.  Krista charges over to a BRUISED AND BLEEDING Wyatt just as he stands -- and SLAPS him!

KRISTA
How dare you bully my son... Wait! You -- you look familiar... Oh my god, I know you!

Krista stares at Wyatt, shoulder bared. Her eyes widen -- *\**does she see Wyatt's SCAR!?!

-- PAYWALL 1 --

_E_PISODE 12

Krista's eyes rake over Wyatt, her lip curling with disgust.

KRISTA
You're that juvenile delinquent the school board should've expelled!

PIERCE
No shit. That explains the cheating. I didn't realize I was playing against a convict!

WYATT
I'm not a convict!

PIERCE
You tried to mess with me in the locker room, he's fucking sus!

KRISTA
You shouldn't even be allowed at this school, let alone this team!

ISABELLA
Mom, I think there's been a misunderstanding, I was here, Wyatt did nothing wrong --

KRISTA
Isabella, whose side are you on?
Pierce would never lie to us. This boy's a menace.

PIERCE
And a ticking time bomb. He'll probably assault another player.

TYLER
He's got a temper, everyone was talking about it. I doubt anyone will play, with him on the team.

WYATT
I didn't do anything!

KRISTA
You think anyone is going to trust *you*?! You already have a criminal record at 17! I'll have my husband kick you off this team before you hurt my family.

WYATT
You can't do that. I earned my spot!

PIERCE
Mom, if he wants to be on this team so bad, then let him prove it.

Pierce steps into Wyatt's space with a smug grin. Krista smirks while Isabella looks away, the only one with a heart.

PIERCE
Get down on your knees and beg, then maybe we'll let you be the water boy.

WYATT
Get out of my face.

ISABELLA
Pierce, stop. Mom, he's going too far!

KRISTA
Thugs like him need to be put in their place. Or they'll just keep coming back like a begging dog.

TYLER
Oh, he knows his place. It's right down in the sewers, that's why he smells like shit.

PIERCE
And if he wants a shot at getting that scholarship, he'll get down and lick the bottom of my cleat.

WYATT
I mean it, back the fuck up.

PIERCE
Make me.

Pierce SPITS in Wyatt's face. Wyatt stiffens as it drips down. Then, he fires back with an uppercut! Pierce is knocked back, but quickly recovers and tackles Wyatt to the ground.

ISABELLA
Guys stop! They're gonna kill each other. DAD!

KRISTA
Pierce, that's enough. I think he's learned his lesson.

Through the fight Wyatt's jersey is torn even further, his **shoulder scar fully exposed**!  Trent rushes back out.

TRENT
HEY! BREAK IT UP!

He pries the boys off of each other, leaving Wyatt, bloody and wincing, on the ground.

TRENT
What's going on?!

PIERCE
It was that pathetic thug on the ground, he just came at me!

They ALL look over to see Wyatt still hunched over on the ground, his scar in full view. Trent stares at him, his brows furrowing -- ***do they see it?***  (WE WANT THE AUDIENCE TO THINK TRENT IS GONNA REALIZE, THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT.)

-- PAYWALL 2 --

_E_PISODE 13

Wyatt adjusts his jersey before anyone sees the scar. He stands and face the outraged Bradshaws.

PIERCE
This punk's gonna fuck up everything you've built, Dad, he's a vicious loser drooling over that scholarship.

KRISTA
I told you offering money would attract the wrong type of people!
Everyone's looking for a hand out.

WYATT
(ignores Pierce, at Trent)
Your son picked a fight with me and broke my helmet! Then attacked me! I'm not the problem here!

KRISTA
What about your juvenile record?

Wyatt goes quiet.

KRISTA 
Yeah, that shut you up, didn't it? Trent, did you realize this boy's been in and out of juvie. The school board was considering expelling him when they found out, but some members took pity.

TRENT
I can't believe we almost had a convict on the team.

ISABELLA
Dad, I think it's only fair to hear Wyatt out, I didn't see him attack --

KRISTA
You should be looking out for Pierce, you're his big sister.

Isabella flinches, haunted by Asher's loss.

PIERCE
You weren't in the locker room when this freak went mental, he's dangerous and a fucking cheat.

WYATT
You're a liar.

TRENT
Enough! I raised good and honest kids, unlike you. Clearly, your dad failed as a father, but that doesn't mean we have to take pity on your sorry ass.

TYLER
Mr. Bradshaw, you've built a legacy, don't let some broke-ass bitch with a rap sheet ruin that.

PIERCE
I'm not going to play on the same team where I'm the target of some raging penniless thug.

TRENT
Don't worry, no son of mine will face a moment of injustice --

Wyatt looks at Trent and is struck by a memory, pressing his hands to his throbbing temples as we **FLASHBACK TO**:

.**INT. BRADSHAW MANSION, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)** #16#

Trent bandages up Asher's (5) gashed shoulder, where he now has the scar. Asher bravely holds back tears.

YOUNG ASHER
The bullies were calling Johnny names, so I tried to stop them.

TRENT
You were so brave, but don't worry, *no son of mine will face a moment of injustice --*

**END FLASHBACK.**

.**EXT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS** #17#

Wyatt frowns in a hazy thought, struggles to remember, then...

WYATT
(uncertain)
Dad?

-- PAYWALL 3 --

_E_PISODE 14

Everyone is taken aback, even Wyatt who stares up at Trent blankly. Trent looks at Wyatt with piercing intensity...

WYATT
(internal voice)
*Why did I say that?*

TRENT
What did you just say?

PIERCE
He's crazy. Probably a coked out junky from the streets --

ISABELLA
Pierce, lay off!

TYLER
That's probably why he's so desperate for the money, he needs to fuel his addiction.

WYATT
I'm not a druggy!

Krista pulls Trent in close enough so only he can hear...

KRISTA
Trent, we have to protect Isabella and Pierce. We can't risk it.

TRENT
Alright...
(barking to Wyatt)
Wyatt, pack up your shit --

WYATT
(internal voice)
*I don't want to give that prick Pierce the satisfaction of winning -- but I also can't risk losing the scholarship. It's my only chance at a normal life!!!*
(out loud)
No! Please, sir, I need this. I won't cause any trouble, I promise.

Isabella looks at him with pity while Pierce sneers.

PIERCE
Groveling? You're pathetic.

WYATT
I'm not talking to you.

KRISTA
You're not *talking* to anyone! You heard my husband, grab your gear and go!

WYATT
This is all I have! And that \*scholarship --

TRENT
You're off the team, Wyatt Lewis.

Wyatt eyes dart between the three faces, reality sinking in. He grabs his broken helmet and takes a sulking turn towards the locker rooms. Just then, he's SMACKED to the ground.

Utterly confused, Wyatt lifts his gaze to see Donny towering over him. Donny glares down, his face twisted with furry.

DONNY
You think you can sneak off on me you ungrateful brat? I have half the mind to sack Hugo for covering your ass!

WYATT
No, it wasn't his fault!

TRENT
Who the hell are you?

Donny notices the others, eyes snapping to Trent. His anger melts to starstruck admiration as he grabs Trent's hand.

DONNY
Mr. Bradshaw, I can't believe it's you! It's been 12 years, 3 months, and 6 days since! Do you remember? I'm your number one fan!

Trent yanks his hand from Donny's grip.

TRENT
Get off... your boy was picking a fight with my son.

Donny's eyes drift to Pierce, standing beside Trent.

DONNY
(internal voice)
\*Son? The Bradshaw's only had one boy, which means this must be...
Wyatt! My son!\*

_**E**_**PISODE 14**

Pierce locks eyes with Donny, grimacing in disgust -- but then a familiarity strikes him. He scans Donny incredulously.

PIERCE
(internal voice, mad and panic)
*Why is this creep staring at me... and why does he look so familiar?!*

Pierce's face falters -- eyes widen, jaw slackens, breath hitches as he's knocked into a **FLASHBACK TO:**

.**INT. BRADSHAW'S SPORTING GOODS - DAY (FLASHBACK)** #18#

Hazy images of FLAMES and distant SCREAMS as Wyatt (5) rushes through thick smoke. He spots Donny sneaking out the exit.

YOUNG WYATT
DADDY!!!

**END FLASHBACK.**

.**EXT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS** #19#

Pierce stiffens, pushing back his memories.

PIERCE
(internal voice, panicking)
*Holy fuck! I know my name was Wyatt before I was adopted by the Bradshaws.  Is this lowlife my real father?  Oh my God... then that means that punk Wyatt Lewis must be the real Asher Bradshaw?!  No! No fucking way!  If Trent finds out*, *he'll* dump me and *I will be stuck with this stinky loser forever!!!*

DONNY
(emotional)
My son...

The tension builds. Pierce flinches. Then, Donny recovers, roughly grabs onto Wyatt, clearing his throat.

DONNY
My son is a disobedient punk. He's always in trouble.

KRISTA
I can see where he gets it from.

TRENT
I don't wanna catch him here again!

DONNY
Of course, Mr. Bradshaw.
(dragging Wyatt off)
Come on, you're embarrassing me.

ISABELLA
Wait! Dad, this is a mistake.

KRISTA
Isabella, zip-it!

ISABELLA
No, think about the publicity, taking pity on a lost cause.
(motioning to Pierce)
That's the Bradshaw way, right?

PIERCE
He's not a lost cause, he's a thug!

ISABELLA
A thug with an arm! Imagine the headlines, *'Trent Bradshaw Saves a Prodigy From A Life Behind Bars!*" Dad, just give him a chance...

_**E**_**PISODE 15**

Trent stares at Isabella, then turns to Wyatt, eyes steely.

TRENT
Fine. Wyatt, one step out of line and you'll never play again. Got it?

WYATT
Yes! I won't let you down, Coach!

PIERCE
Dad, no, he's a delinquent!

KRISTA
Honey, think this through!

TRENT
Isabella's right, and I'm done discussing it.
(to Wyatt)
You'll need new gear by Monday, throw out this cheap trash. Or don't step foot on my field.

Trent heads for his office, an irate Krista on his heels. Pierce takes a final opportunity to shoulder check Wyatt.

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*He may be the heir, but he'll never have the Bradshaw name.*
(out loud)
Come on, Tyler, I'm choking on the stench of thrift store pity and government handouts.

Pierce avoids looking at Donny as he heads for the locker room, followed by Tyler.  Wyatt exhales, relief flooding him.

WYATT
(internal voice)
*I did it! I'm on the team, and a step closer to the scholarship.*

Just then, Donny grabs Wyatt in a bruising grip.

DONNY
Wipe that look off your face. You didn't win anything, boy. Unless you can pay for all this fancy gear, you ain't playing shit. And you're not getting a dime out of me.

WYATT
I've done everything else on my own! I'll do this too!
(internal voice)
*And when I get that scholarship I'm out, and you can rot in that dump of a trailer alone.*

ANGLE ON Isabella watching Wyatt storm away.

BACK ON Wyatt as he HURLS his crappy helmet into a trash can, then KICKS the can, knocking it over as he rails.

ISABELLA
Wyatt, wait up!

Wyatt doesn't turn as Isabella catches up to him.

WYATT
Just leave me alone.

ISABELLA
I... I wanted to apologize for my family, they can be pretty intense.

WYATT
Yeah, I'd probably go with a different word than "intense."

ISABELLA
You have to understand, they've been burned before, 12 years ago my little brother went missing --

WYATT
I don't care what excuse you've got for those assholes. I just need to keep my head down, play ball, and earn that scholarship. Buying new gear's already enough of a bitch.

Isabella looks at his helmet spilling from the trash can.

ISABELLA
If you need money for new gear, my family owns Bradshaw Sporting Goods. I can get you a job and a 30 percent discount. I just wanna make things right.

_**E**_**PISODE 16**

.**INT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, LOCKER ROOM - AT THAT MOMENT** #20#

Pierce finishes dressing when the DOOR OPENS and Donny enters.

DONNY
My son!

Pierce's breath hitches, like he sees a ghost. He quickly recovers, brushing past Donny on his way to the door.

PIERCE
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, freak.

He grabs his backpack, turns to find Donny now right beside him, arms reaching for him -- Pierce shoves Donny off.

PIERCE
Dude, back off! You're nothing but a sperm donor -- you will never be my father! I'm a Bradshaw!

DONNY
(overjoyed)
I KNOW!!!  My own flesh and blood is a Bradshaw! Isn't it wonderful? My plan worked!

PIERCE
Plan?

DONNY
When you were little I swapped you with Asher. I changed his name to Wyatt Lewis, and made sure he disappeared. You became Pierce Bradshaw, adopted and raised by the great Trent Bradshaw! It was the only way to give you the life you deserve. The life we deserve.

PIERCE
So, you're not gonna tell?

DONNY
Tell? God, no! You have to keep going, all the way to the top!
You'll be NFL royalty.

PIERCE
Unless that fucktard son of yours gets in my way.

DONNY
Don't worry, I'll handle him.

_**E**_**PISODE 17**

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - EVENING** #21#

Wyatt (in basic T-shirt & jeans) follows Isabella (in her cheerleader uniform) around the rebuilt store.

ISABELLA
It's just basic retail -- stocking shelves, running the register, a little cleaning here and there.
Think you can handle that?

WYATT
Sounds like a breeze compared to my other job. And the AC is a bonus.

ISABELLA
Oh, you have another job?

WYATT
I do work for my dad. But doesn't pay me -- says it's what I owe him for keeping a roof over my head.

ISABELLA
That's awful.

WYATT
Yeah, well... it is what it is.

ISABELLA
This job's minimum wage, but at least it's *something*.

She motions to a rack of sparkling new football gear.

ISABELLA 
And like I said, 30% off.
(playfully whispers)
50% if you use the friends and family discount.

They share a smile, then Wyatt's expression shifts, hardens.

WYATT
Why are you helping me?

ISABELLA
I don't know... You just remind me of someone...

Isabella's voice drifts off as we **FLASHBACK TO:**

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - DAY (FLASHBACK)** #22A#

Isabella (7) chases after Asher (5), their tiny feet pounding against the floor.  Their LAUGHTER fills the store with pure, carefree joy. Asher turns back, grinning when Isabella tags

\*him, both giggling.  **END FLASHBACK.**

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - EVENING** #22#

Isabella looks at Wyatt, her eyes watery.

ISABELLA
(internal voice)
*How do I tell you that I'm haunted by my long lost little brother... That I never stopped searching for his smile?*
(out loud, covers her emotions)
Anyway, come on, I'll get you trained and up to speed.

**TIME LEAP** -- Isabella leads Wyatt to the back where a MODERN ELECTRICAL BOX is on the wall. She shows it to Wyatt, eyes sad.

ISABELLA 
And in case of an emergency, this is the fuse box. You probably won't ever need to touch it, but years ago there was... forget it.

WYATT
What?

ISABELLA
(near tears)
There was a fire...

WYATT
A fire?

Suddenly, Wyatt can hear the CRACKLING of FLAMES and the AGONIZING SCREAMS as we --

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - DAY (FLASHBACK)** #22B#

INSERT: **FLASHBACK**. The fire ROARS as Asher sits in the aisle hugging his bloody knee. He CHOKES on the billowing SMOKE.

YOUNG ASHER
DAD!

**END FLASHBACK.**

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - CONTINUOUS** #23#

ISABELLA
Wyatt?

Wyatt startles back to reality. He stares at Isabella intensely -- *almost as though his memories are coming back!*

ISABELLA
Are you okay?

_**E**_**PISODE 16**

Wyatt blinks, shaking off the strange moment.

WYATT
Uh, yeah, sorry. Sometimes I just *drift*, I don't know.

ISABELLA
I get what you mean, it just takes one thing and suddenly I'm back here, 12 years ago when we lost our...
Never mind, I'll grab your uniform, I promise it won't be too hideous.

WYATT
(gesturing to his vest)
As long as it's not orange, that's not really my color.

Isabella LAUGHS and heads off. Wyatt scans the room, taking it all in, then his eyes fall back on the electrical box.

WYATT
(muttered)
What's wrong with me?

PIERCE (O.C.)
Hey, cocksucker...

Wyatt SIGHS at the all-too-familiar voice. He turns to see Pierce marching over with Tyler following behind.

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*So what if Wyatt is the real Bradshaw heir. For as long as I live, this punk will never take my spot in the Bradshaw family!*
  
(out loud)
Are you trying to shoplift now? 'Cause we all know you can't afford anything in here.

WYATT
Damn, you caught me, guess I never learned my lesson after juvie.

PIERCE
Joke all you want, but when I'm done with you, you're gonna wish you were behind bars.

TYLER
I can't believe we have to put with this poser for the whole season.

WYATT
(to Tyler)
So, how much is this spoiled punk paying you to kiss his ass?

PIERCE
You wanna talk about money when you're the one begging for service job?

Pierce shoves Wyatt into a display shelf. Isabella rushes in with an EMPLOYEE POLO AND NAME TAG.

ISABELLA
Pierce, stop! Wyatt's our new employee!

PIERCE
The fuck you say!

ISABELLA
Pierce, he's a good guy, just --

PIERCE
Why are you taking his side, he's nothing! A waste of space!

WYATT
Save it for my employee review.

Wyatt grabs the polo, wasting no time. He pulls his shirt up and the SCAR IS REVEALED right in front of Isabella.

PIERCE
(internal voice)
SHIT! If Isabella sees that scar... She'll realize Wyatt is actually her long-lost brother, Asher Bradshaw!  And if that happens...
I'm screwed.\*

_**E**_**PISODE 17**

Pierce yanks Wyatt's shirt down and shove him back in one swift move. He snatches the employee polo, taunting Wyatt with it.

PIERCE
You're ass is fired! You don't even deserve to spit shine our shoes.

Wyatt pushes back and the guys are nearly at each others throats. Isabella gets in between the two of them.

ISABELLA
Quit it, Pierce!

PIERCE
Do you really think Mom and Dad would hire this convict?

ISABELLA
He's an athlete, I think he's a good fit --

PIERCE
A good fit? He's been to juvie for stealing! He has a record!

TYLER
If he keeps running his mouth, he'll tank the team before the season even starts.

ISABELLA
People shouldn't be condemned for their past mistakes.

PIERCE
*Mistakes?* Is that what we're calling felonies now?

WYATT
I don't have a felony.

ISABELLA
Pierce, what's gotten into you?

PIERCE
He's a fucking criminal! Think of what that would do to us! You know how hard mom and dad work to uphold the Bradshaw name.

ISABELLA
Our family's known for kindness and generosity, he needs our help.

PIERCE
(smugly to Wyatt)
You must feel pretty small, hearing her stick up for you like some kind of puppy at the pound.

Isabella grabs the employee polo back and passes it to Wyatt.

ISABELLA
Don't listen to him. Here, there's a changing room in the back.

Wyatt nods graciously and slips off, ignoring Pierce's glare.

PIERCE
Whatever. Just be ready for when he proves me right. Come on, Tyler, let's get out of here.

Pierce and Tyler trail out, swiping merchandise as they go. Isabella lingers, unsettled --

ISABELLA
(internal voice)
*What was I thinking? This isn't the little brother I know. It can't be...*

.**INT. BRADSHAW MANSION, OFFICE - DAY** #24#

Trent is at his desk looking over a football playbook. The door is thrown open as the lead detective rushes in.

LEAD DETECTIVE
Sir, we have a matching scar!

>_**E**_**PISODE 18**

Trent snaps up and grabs the photo with trembling hands.

TRENT
Let me see it!

CLOSE ON THE PHOTO showing the back of WYATT'S SHOULDER WITH THE JAGGED SCAR. No other discernible features are seen.

TRENT
This is it! This is the same scar as my long lost boy! Where is he now?

LEAD DETECTIVE
We don't know who the scar belongs to yet, but we've narrowed it down to someone at Riverstone High.

TRENT The high school where I coach football. I want you to speak to every single boy at the school! I don't care how long it takes -- just find me!

LEAD DETECTIVE
Yes, sir.

The detective hurries out the room as Trent looks at a childhood photo of Asher on his desk.

TRENT
(softly, voice hopeful)
Asher, hang on, son, I *will* find you.

ANGLE ON Pierce lurking by the door, having heard *everything*.

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*He's getting closer...*

PIERCE
*If they find out Wyatt is actually Asher, they won't need for an adopted son like me! I'll be nothing. I have to stop this!*

.**EXT. BRADSHAW MANSION, BACKYARD - DAY** #25#

Krista is directing PARTY DECORATORS, putting up banners that read 'Happy Birthday, Isabella'. Pierce strides over.

PIERCE
Are we going to be using the pool for Izzy's party? You know the drain's f'ed up.

KRISTA
What? When did that happen?

_**CU**_ **SHOT**: Pierce's hands behind his back hiding a WRENCH.

PIERCE
Don't worry, Mom, I can call the handyman.

KRISTA
Oh, honey, you're the best!

Krista bustles from the room as Pierce pulls up on his CELL a YELP PAGE for 'Lewis the Handyman'.

PIERCE
I am the best...
(internal voice)
*And tonight, Wyatt Lewis aka the lost son of the Bradshaws will be back in juvie where he belongs.*

Pierce slips one of Trent's Super Bowl rings in his pocket.

**EPISODE 19**

.**INT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP - DAY** #26#

Wyatt is hard at work alongside Hugo sanding a wooden table. Wyatt stops, chugging a bottle of water.

HUGO
You look tired, bro. Staying up too late partying with the cheerleaders?

WYATT
I took on another job to pay for my new football gear.

HUGO
Two jobs, school, and practice, when do you have time to sleep?

WYATT
I'll be fine.

Suddenly, Donny grabs Wyatt's hammer mid swing.

DONNY
You're making a house call at 6. New client's pool filter's jammed.

WYATT
But I've got practice --

Donny rips the hammer from Wyatt and flings it. BANG!

DONNY
Well, that's too damn bad! This job comes first, son.

HUGO
I can go, sir, I could use the extra money --

DONNY
Did I ask for volunteers? Mind your \*business or I'll sack you.

Donny trudges off and Wyatt clenches his jaw. He picks up the hammer and quietly returns to his work.

HUGO
Jesus, your dad's messed up.

WYATT
He's the only family I got.

_**E**_**PISODE 20**

.**EXT. BRADSHAW MANSION, BACKYARD - NIGHT** #27#

Streamers dazzle a lavish poolside, as HIGH SCHOOLERS dance to POP MUSIC. Isabella, wearing a "Birthday Girl" sash over her sleeveless maxi dress, drinks with the other cheerleaders.

CHEERLEADER 1
This party is insane!

ISABELLA
Yeah, that's my mom, she always has to make everything a big show.

Krista pops up with a camera gathering the girls.

KRISTA
Alright, big smiles, everyone!

As she SNAPS the picture, the back fence opens. Wyatt enters in orange vest, confused by the raging party.

KRISTA
Oh, the handyman is here.

Everyone turns to see Wyatt in his work getup.

WYATT
(internal voice)
*Where the hell are we, this mansion is insane -- wait, this is the Bradshaw Mansion? What the hell?!*
(out loud)
Hey, Isabella.

ISABELLA
Wyatt, what are you doing here?
Mom, what's going on?

KRISTA
\*Well, he was supposed to get here before the party! But it's so hard to find good help.

Krista frowns and halts in front of Wyatt.

KRISTA
Oh! It's you.
(suspicious)
What are you doing in my home?

WYATT
Lady, you called us.

Krista takes in his orange vest.

KRISTA
Of course. You're the handyman.
That makes way more sense than football player.

Wyatt's face hardens at the dig.

KRISTA
The pool is over there. It needs a new filter. Stay away from the house -- I don't trust you not to rob the place.

The crowd erupts in LAUGHTER -- except for Isabella.

WYATT
You can clean your own dirty pool, lady. I'm outta here.

KRISTA
You leave and I'll destroy your pathetic family business.

WYATT
Fine. Just stay out of my way.

_**E**_**PISODE 21**

Wyatt SCOOPS SLOP OUT OF THE POOL FILTER as the party carries on around him. It is a new low for him and it's on his face.

ACROSS THE PARTY, Krista wheels out a giant birthday cake with flickering candles.

KRISTA
Alright, everyone, gather around!

Wyatt watches from the distance -- longingly, as the group begins to SINGS HAPPY BIRTHDAY. Donny WHACKS him.

DONNY
Get back to work!

Isabella looks at all the candles as the SONG FINISHES.

KRISTA
Okay, honey, make a wish!

Isabella closes her eyes, and she hears the DISTANT LAUGHTER of ASHER (5). Her breath stifles, **FLASHBACK TO:**

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - DAY (FLASHBACK)** #28#

Asher (5) and Isabella (7) sprint down an aisle LAUGHING. Isabella sees her brother trip, she rushes to him.

YOUNG ASHER
Don't worry, it's just a scratch.

YOUNG ISABELLA
You're bleeding! Stay here, I won't let anything happen to you.

Isabella hugs Asher, and in her ear he whispers:

YOUNG ASHER
You're the best big sister ever.

**END FLASHBACK.**

.**EXT. BRADSHAW MANSION, BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS** #29#

Isabella blows out the candles.

ISABELLA
(internal voice)
*Please, Asher, come home.*

She opens her eyes, glistening with tears as EVERYONE CLAPS. She quickly wipes them and flashes a pearly smile.

PIERCE (O.C.)
Looky, looky who it is.

Wyatt stiffens, turning to see Pierce as he strides into the party, followed by the rest of the FOOTBALL PLAYERS.

PIERCE
  
(internal voice)
*Time to drive a wedge between the Bradshaws and their real son so they'll never take him back.*

_**E**_**PISODE 22**

Pierce, with the other football players flanking him, comes to a stop before Wyatt.

PIERCE
Skipping practice to crash my sister's party?

Wyatt stands up straight with his head high.

PIERCE
Wait -- hold up! Are you the fucking help now! Every time I see you, you hit a new low.

Pierce and the other football players snicker.

WYATT
It's honest work. Unlike you, living off your daddy's name. Too bad you don't have an ounce of his talent.

PIERCE
You don't get it, loser. It doesn't matter how good you are, you'll always be a nobody. The peak of your existence will be watching me win the Super Bowl while you scrub toilets for a living.

WYATT
So you agree. I am better.

Before Wyatt can blink -- Pierce's fist hurls towards his face! Wyatt grabs Pierce's arm just in time, and follows through with an uppercut. Pierce takes the hit, before lunging into an attack.

They wrestle like savages. The crowd GASPS. Isabella rushes over.

ISABELLA
STOP IT! STOP!!!

Pierce manages to pin Wyatt down.

PIERCE
I'M NOT DONE WITH HIM YET!

WYATT
BRING IT ON THEN!

Wyatt flips Pierce and socks him in the nose.

BY THE GATE, Krista slips out on her CELL.

KRISTA
(into cell, hysterical)
Hello, police! There's a maniac attacking my son! Please, I need an officer over here right now! Oh, god! He's an animal, please hurry!!!

_**E**_**PISODE 23**

BY THE POOL, Wyatt gets in a few good blows before Pierce is kneeing Wyatt's ribs. Blood is being shed by both boys, and the fight is growing more violent by the minute.

Pierce wraps his hands around Wyatt's neck. He clamps down hard and Wyatt goes red, GASPING for air.

ISABELLA
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!

**CLOSE ON** Pierce slipping the Super Bowl ring into his pocket.

Isabella grabs Pierce's shoulders and tries to pry him off.

PIERCE
Let go!

Pierce swats Isabella away. She stumbles in her heels, topples backward into the deep end of the pool. SPLASH!

_**UN**_**DERWATER SHOT:** Her long maxi dress gets caught by the filter at the bottom, **suctioning her down like a vacuum!**

Isabella thrashes, bubbles erupt from her mouth. The pump groans above ground. (**SFX**)

Krista runs over, spots Isabella, her voice panicking.

KRISTA
ISABELA!!! OH MY GOD!

Donny frantically tries to shut off the filter's POWER BOX.

DONNY
The filter's got her! It's sucking her under!

Wyatt spots Isabella sinking, SLAMS Pierce aside, DIVING IN!

_**UN**_**DERWATER SHOT:** Wyatt swims hard to the bottom, grabs the dress, pulls out a UTILITY KNIFE, CUTS HER FREE!

_**SU**_**RFACE SHOT**: He bursts up with Isabella in his arms.

He pulls Isabella to steps in the shallow end -- she is gasping but alive. EVERYONE CHEERS.

Isabella and Wyatt climb out of the pool, panting.

ISABELLA
Tha-n-k y-ou! I was so-so scared.

WYATT
Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to you.

Isabella looks at him, her eyes unexpectedly welling with tears. She hears her younger self, distantly saying...

ISABELLA (V.O.)
Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to you.

Isabella stares at Wyatt, her heart in her throat.

ISABELLA
What did you say?

_**E**_**PISODE 24**

Before Wyatt can answer, Krista and Pierce charge forward.

PIERCE
Get your hands off my sister!

WYATT
I just saved her --

KRISTA
(to Isabella)
Oh god, did he hurt you, honey!

ISABELLA
What? Mom, no, he --

Suddenly, the back doors of the mansion swing open as Trent storms out. He scans the aftermath, landing on Wyatt.

TRENT
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON OUT HERE?!?

Krista rushes over to Trent, taking charge of the situation.

KRISTA
That juvenile delinquent and his freak of a father just showed up here to cause a scene!

DONNY
Mr. Bradshaw, I promise I just came to do a my job--

TRENT
I don't want to hear a god damn word come out of your mouth!
(getting in Wyatt's face)
I took a chance on you, what do you have to say for yourself?

WYATT
What does it matter, you're not gonna believe me.

PIERCE
I tried to stop him, but he attacked me. He shoved Isabella in the pool, she almost drowned!

ISABELLA
What? No, he --

Trent grabs Wyatt by the scruff of his neck. Trent's eyes burning with a rage, unlike we've seen from him before.

TRENT
YOU LAID YOUR FILTHY HANDS ON MY LITTLE GIRL?!?

ISABELLA
DAD, STOP! IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!!!

Isabella pulls Trent off of Wyatt, whose shirt is now torn.

PIERCE
It was an *accident* that he skipped practice to show up uninvited at your birthday?!? Total creeper.

KRISTA
Is this the type of player you want on your team? Ruining your daughter's party, coming after our family? You need to end this.

Wyatt straightens with reliance and looks down on the Bradshaw's with a dark glare.

WYATT
You're right, I'm done with this shit.

**SLOW-MO: ***Wyatt turns to leave, and*** *_h_is scar comes into view*** _***fo***_***r everyone.*** *Pierce spots it, his eyes widen...*

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*NO! Trent's looking right at him, he'll see that stupid scar and know he's Asher, his real son!*

_**E**_**PISODE 25**

Pierce searches for a solution as his eyes land on the cake. He grabs the platter and flings it at Wyatt. The cake hurtles through the air, splattering Wyatt's back and shoulders!

PIERCE
Take your fucking mess with you.

Wyatt snaps around snarling with rage. He takes a step towards Pierce but stills at the blare of POLICE SIRENS. Red and Blue lights flash over the backyards fence as a POLICE OFFICER (30s) rushes through the gate.

POLICE OFFICER
We got a call about an intruder.

Krista plays up her desperation and points at Wyatt.

KRISTA
Oh, thank god you're here, Officer! It's him! He crashed my daughter's birthday and attacked my kids!

WYATT
Come on! This is ridiculous, I didn't do anything!

PIERCE
Didn't do anything?! You rushed me and almost killed my sister!

ISABELLA
That's not true --

KRISTA
She's in shock, Officer, she doesn't know what she's saying...

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*Time to seal his fate with the evidence I planted, good luck getting out of this, juvie...*
(out loud)
Check his pockets, I saw him snooping around our mansion before the party.

WYATT
That's a lie!

OFFICER
Arms up, kid.

Wyatt complies and the Officer pats down his body, discovering the ring. He pulls it out for all to see.

TRENT
That punk stole my Super Bowl ring!

KRISTA
That's worth 80 grand!!!

WYATT
I didn't, I was with my dad the whole time!

TRENT
That doesn't mean shit, his dad is probably just as guilty as he is!

The Officer looks over at Donny who goes white.

DONNY
(internal voice)
*No! I've already done my time! I'm not going back...*
(to the Officer)
My son's troubled. I've tried to get him help, but he's out of control.

OFFICER
Alright, hands behind your back!

Wyatt looks to Donny with familiar betrayal as the Officer pulls out his handcuffs. Isabella rushes to Trent.

ISABELLA
You can't let them do this! You weren't there, Dad! Please, take pity on him. It's my birthday...

Trent stares at his daughter, his hardened expression melting. He sighs, unable to say no to his little girl.

TRENT
Officer, we'll drop any charges...
(to Wyatt)
But you're off the team. I don't want you anywhere near my family or my field, again. So help me god, if I see you, I'll make sure you regret it. Now, get the hell out of here.

The officer un-cuffs Wyatt. Wyatt follows Donny to the gate. He looks back and shares a sad smile with Isabella.

_**E**_**PISODE 26**

.**INT. BRADSHAW MANSION, DINNING ROOM - NIGHT** #30#

Isabella sits in front of what was salvageable of her cake. Krista, Trent, and Pierce are beside her, all dealing with the aftermath of the party.

TRENT
I'm sorry, honey. We can throw you a new party if you want --

KRISTA
Oh, yes! We can go even bigger, roll out a red carpet --

PIERCE
And if that asshole Wyatt shows up I'll break his nose!

ISABELLA
Please, stop, fighting with Wyatt! I wanna forget it ever happened.

Just then, the Lead Detective rushes in.

LEAD DETECTIVE
I'm sorry, I know it's late.

TRENT
Did you find our real son?

LEAD DETECTIVE
We narrowed it down, there's just one boy we haven't checked.

ISABELLA
Who?

Lead Detective shows a photo of Wyatt. _**C**_**U SHOT:** Photo of Wyatt in an orange vest, doing handyman work on someone's house.

LEAD DETECTIVE
Wyatt Lewis.

TRENT
You can't be serious!

ISABELLA
No! Wyatt is my real brother. I can feel it!

The family is stunned -- *Earth shattering news.*

KRISTA
No... No that -- that can't be right. There's gotta be others...

LEAD DETECTIVE
Of course, we're not ruling anything out, but right now Wyatt is our best lead on your lost son, Asher.

TRENT
You mean I just threatened my own son?! Oh god, what have I done?

PIERCE
But he's a criminal.

Isabella stands from her chair, fists clenched.

ISABELLA
Wyatt could be our lost brother! Dad, please, we have to find him -- now!

KRISTA
No. Pierce is right.

TRENT
What? Krista, for the past 12 years you've been grieving the loss of our little boy to every reporter and journalist that'll listen!

KRISTA
(with tears in her eyes)
Because I kept hoping we would find Asher! But all it did was draw every scumbag and fake to our door! All they wanted was our money and fame. All they wanted was to prey on our grief!  This Wyatt, with his unsavory background, odds are he's just like all the others.
(tears streaming)
And I can't hope anymore, Trent, I just can't.

ISABELLA
But if there's even a chance he's Asher -- please, I think about that moment I lost him every single day!

PIERCE
Mom's right. We can't bring a vicious thug under this roof.

Krista stands up rigidly and pushes past the detective out of the dinning room. Isabella looks to Trent, teary eyed.

TRENT
Don't worry, we're going to go talk to him first thing in the morning.

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*No! This can't be happening. If they find out that Wyatt is actually their long lost son, they'll replace me with him! I need to get to my dirtbag real dad first. I need to end Wyatt Lewis!*

_**E**_**PISODE 27**

.**INT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP - NEXT DAY** #31#

\*Donny is working as Pierce sneaks inside, his eyes darting around to make sure they're alone.

DONNY
What are you doing? Wyatt's already in the back! You're gonna get caught, son!

PIERCE
Don't call me that! I may be your biological son, but I'm a Bradshaw through and through, just like you wanted -- but that's about to end.

DONNY
What! What do you mean?

PIERCE
That damn detective put the pieces together. Trent's on his way to see if Wyatt has the same jagged scar as his missing son.

DONNY
Shit! This is bad, he'll know I kidnapped his son and send me back to prison!

Pierce grabs onto Donny.

PIERCE
More importantly, he'll toss me aside -- who needs their adoptive son when the real heir returns!  You wanted me to have this life, right?

DONNY
Of course, more than anything!

PIERCE
Then help me! We need a way to destroy that scar...

Donny's lights up with a dastardly plan.

DONNY
I have just the thing...

Donny's eyes go to the _**R**_**ED HOT SOLDERING IRON _P_LUGGED IN**.

_**E**_**PISODE 28**

.**EXT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP - CONTINUOUS** #32#

Trent's bad-ass luxury car speeding into the shop's SURFACEPARKING LOT, SCREECHING TO A HALT.  Trent steps out of thecar, followed by Isabella. The two strut towards the shop as Donny steps outside to greet them.

DONNY
Mr. Bradshaw, it's an *honor--*

TRENT
Where's Wyatt?

DONNY
Please, sir, that boy is trouble, I don't want him to upset you anymore. I think it'd be best if --

TRENT
I didn't ask you for your opinion, I asked you to tell me where he is!

DONNY
He's not here, the little brat always shows up late.

ISABELLA
\*We'll wait.

.**INT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP - DAY** #33#

Pierce slips past SHELVES OF TOOLS and WORKTABLES. He spots a **glowing SOLDERING IRON** under a '**CAUTION: HOT'** SIGN.

Pierce grabs it. SIZZLE! (**SFX**) He tests it on scrap wood -- it burns **a black mark**. He cracks a devilish grin.

.**EXT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP, BACK AREA - DAY** #34#

Wyatt, vest off in the heat and shirtless,  is bent over a bench, **shoulder scar** exposed... just as Pierce creeps up.

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*No more Asher Bradshaw --*

Pierce jabs the iron onto the scar! SSSSZZZZTT! (**SFX**)

Wyatt lets out **a blood-curdling scream** -- smoke curls of his flesh as Pierce jerks the iron away, revealing a **RAW, BLISTERING MESS OF BURNED SKIN**!

_**E**_**PISODE 29**

.**INT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP - DAY** #35#

Trent is in the middle of berating Donny, when they **ALL HEAR THE TERRIBLE SCREAM!**

ISABELLA
WYATT!

Trent looks around wide-eyed, as we **FLASHBACK TO:**

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - DAY (FLASHBACK)** #36#

The FANS SCREAM and swarm in every direction. Isabella dodges through bodies, running up to an alarmed Trent and Krista.

TRENT
Isabella, where's your brother?

YOUNG ISABELLA
In the back!

Trent heroically hops the table and heads towards the rear.

TRENT
ASHER! SON!!!

**END FLASHBACK.**

.**EXT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP, BACK AREA - DAY** #37#

Isabella and Trent race in the direction of the scream --

TRENT
WHERE ARE YOU?

Donny runs in after them, latching on to Trent.

DONNY
Mr. Bradshaw, stay here!

Trent throws Donny to the ground.

TRENT
GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF ME...
(turning)
WYATT, WE'RE COMING!

Donny pulls himself up as Isabella and Trent take off. He follows behind, limping after them.

ANGLE ON Pierce drops the soldering iron -- it CLATTERS to the floor. He spins and bolts. WHAM!  He SLAMS straight into Trent and Isabella!

TRENT
Pierce...?

ISABELLA
(spotting Wyatt)
Oh god! Wyatt!!!

Isabella pushes past Pierce and Trent to crouch beside Wyatt. He's broken into dripping sweat and his shoulder skin is burned!

TRENT
(internal voice)
*His shoulder! There's no way to tell if he had a scar...*

ISABELLA
What happened!?!

WYATT
Ask your brother!

ISABELLA
What did you do to him?!?

PIERCE
I didn't do anything, he's crazy!

TRENT
I want the truth, now!

PIERCE
Are you seriously gonna believe *him* over me, after everything he's done! He's a jailbird, a criminal.

ISABELLA
Why would he do this to himself!?!

PIERCE
Cause he wants our money! Probably staged this so he can sue us!

WYATT
I don't want your fucking money!

TRENT
Pierce, look me in the eye and tell me what you're doing here!

PIERCE
Dad! I -- I was just -- Um...

_**E**_**PISODE 30**

Pierce glances between Trent and Isabella. _**C**_**U SHOT**: Pierce's sweaty brow. His fingers twitching at his sides.

PIERCE
I was just --

Donny hobbles into the back room just in time.

DONNY
Your son was just stopping by to make amends with my boy Wyatt. You raised a very admirable young man, Mr. Bradshaw.
(looks at Wyatt, over the top)
Oh god, Wyatt! My poor boy!
Everybody, please move aside!

Donny tries to help Wyatt up, he GROANS in misery.

WYATT
Get off me! You were part of this!

DONNY
Son, you're delusional. We need to get you the hospital right now!

TRENT
Wyatt, tell us what really \*happened!

Donny's eyes flicker toward Pierce.

DONNY
(covering)
Wyatt must've tripped into the soldering iron --

WYATT
I didn't trip, Dad! It was jammed into my shoulder like a knife!

DONNY
*Jammed*? You're delirious. Probably hit your head too. Come on, let's get you to the hospital.

Donny tries to pull Wyatt away. Wyatt resists. Trent's eyes narrow, suspicion deepens.

TRENT
Everybody. Hold on.
(eye-to-eye with Wyatt)
Wyatt, please, we need to know, did you have a scar on the back of your shoulder?

Wyatt's head jerks up --*\** how does he know?\*

_E_PISODE 31

Wyatt stares at Trent, almost forgetting the pain.

WYATT
How did you know --

DONNY
We don't have time for this! We need to get him to a doctor now, can't you see he's in critical condition!

Donny, still limping, props up Wyatt by his good shoulder, keeping him steady as they move.

TRENT
We'll meet you at the hospital.

DONNY
Mr. Bradshaw, please, I don't want my son in anymore trouble. Just stay away from him.

WYATT
But --

Donny pulls Wyatt in close so only he can hear.

DONNY
Don't say a god damn word.
(loudly)
Oh god, we need to hurry, son!

As Donny carries Wyatt down the hallway, Isabella follows.

TRENT
Isabella, don't.

ISABELLA
We can't just let that creep take him, he's obviously hiding something!

PIERCE
That *creep* is his dad, and he asked us to stay out of their business.

TRENT
Enough! We're not gonna be a house divided over this! And not a word to your mother. Let's go.

Pierce and Isabella march out of the room. Trent lingers back and picks up Wyatt's hard hat that fell off during the chaos. He flips it over and pulls out a strand of hair.

TRENT
(internal voice)
*If I can't get the truth from Wyatt, I can get it from his DNA.*

_**E**_**PISODE 32**

.**INT. DONNY'S HOME, LIVING ROOM - DAY** #38#

A rundown trailer, with torn furniture and a floor littered with beer bottles. Wyatt ices his bandaged shoulder with a pack of frozen pees. Donny barges in SLAMMING the door.

DONNY
What the hell are you doing sitting around here, huh?

WYATT
The doctor said to take it easy.

DONNY
*Easy*? You're gonna get your ass back to work! You still owe me for those fucking medical bills.

WYATT
How am I supposed to do that when you don't even pay me?

DONNY
You ungrateful little shit!

WYATT
You're a fucking moron, it's child labor! All these years I could've called Child Services on your sorry ass.

Donny gets in Wyatt's face and RIPS the ice pack off and SINKING his fingers into the bandaged wound.

DONNY
As long as you're under my roof, you're gonna obey me like the pathetic bitch you are. Got that?

Wyatt musters enough strength to twist Donny's wrist off his shoulder and SHOVE him aside. He storms over to the door.

WYATT
I'm done living under your roof!

Donny CHUCKS a beer bottle at the door just as Wyatt slams it shut. The bottle SHATTERS and Donny lets out a ROAR.

_**E**_**PISODE 33**

.**EXT. HUGO'S HOME - DAY** #39#

Wyatt, slumped on a railing, repeatedly KNOCKS on a door to a small house. He hears a SHUFFLE from inside.

HUGO (O.S.)
(muffled)
I'm coming, keep your panties on...

Hugo yanks the door open. His cigarette falls out of his lips, as his mouth hangs open at the sight of Wyatt.

HUGO
Jesus, Wyatt, what the hell happened to you???

.**INT. HUGO'S HOME, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER** #40#

A small, but noticeably cozier, home than Donny's. Wyatt sprawls out on the couch as Hugo brings pillows and blankets.

HUGO
I can't believe the fucker did all that. I knew he wasn't the warmest dad, but that's straight up abusive.

WYATT
I guess I got used to him, but I just can't take it anymore.

HUGO
No shit, I'd have strangled him in his sleep if I were you...

Wyatt smirks.

WYATT
I thought about it, but he keeps a gun under his pillow.

HUGO
Yeah, well, kick a dog long enough and it's gonna bite back. Crash here as long as you want.

WYATT
Thanks. Seriously.

HUGO
Of course, dude. Let me know if you need anything.

Wyatt thinks for a moment as Hugo returns to the kitchen.

WYATT
There is this one thing...

_**E**_**PISODE 34**

.**INT. BRADSHAW MANSION, LIVING ROOM - DAY** #41#

Krista is curled up the couch when Pierce storms in, CHUCKING his helmet! Krista sits up.

KRISTA
Pierce? Honey, what's wrong?

PIERCE
That fucking locker room leach framed me by hurting himself, and now Dad and Isabella are pissed.

KRISTA
They talked to Wyatt?
(shakes her head)
They don't really think he's Asher?

PIERCE
That con artist's got them eating out of his hand! What if Dad lets him stay here and he does something to hurt you or god forbid, Isabella --

KRISTA
Don't you worry, Pierce. That trash isn't getting into our home.  He can fool Trent and Isabella, but he can't fool me.

.**INT. TRENT'S PORSCHE SUV (PARKED) - DAY** #42#

Trent SLAMS his fists on his wheel before rubbing his temples with SIGH. Lead Detective in the passenger seat..

TRENT
It just doesn't make sense. What are the odds his shoulder was burned right where the scar should've been? And his deadbeat dad was acting all suspicious... not to mention Pierce...

LEAD DETECTIVE
You think Donny Lewis is behind this?

Trent pulls out a white cloth with Wyatt's strand of hair.

TRENT
I don't know... But, I want you to run a DNA test on this, I got it from Wyatt's helmet the other day.

LEAD DETECTIVE
Yes, sir.

Lead Detective is about to go, then...

TRENT
Oh, and keep this between us. I don't know who I can trust anymore.

_**E**_**PISODE 35**

.**INT. BRADSHAW'S SPORTING GOODS - DAY** #43#

Wyatt, in his store uniform, restocks a football helmet display shelf with Isabella's help.

WYATT
Thanks again, for giving me my job back, despite *everything*.

ISABELLA
Of course, it's the least I could do! I can't believe your dad is making you pay the medical bills!
You know the scholarship is still up for grabs.

WYATT
No offense, but I don't wanna get involved with all that again. The sooner I clear my debt, sooner I'll be free of my dad, and I can start fresh...

ISABELLA
Then what? You're not running off on your own right?

WYATT
I'm almost 18.

ISABELLA
You don't have any other family?

WYATT
I don't really know, it's always just been my dad and me...

Isabella parts her mouth to say *something*, but Wyatt CLEARS HIS THROAT, changing the subject. He admires the helmets.

WYATT
Man, I can't imagine strapping into one of these and hitting the field.

PIERCE (O.C.)
That'll never happen, loser.

Wyatt stiffens at Pierce's grating voice, and turns to see him entering the store with a smug look.

_**E**_**PISODE 36**

Pierce stops in front of Wyatt and Isabella.

PIERCE
You're as bad as herpes, just popping up where no one wants you.

WYATT
I wouldn't be bragging about your herpes, dude.

Pierce SCOFFS and cocks his fist, but Isabella steps between the boys before he can follow through with the punch.

ISABELLA
What are you doing here, Pierce?

PIERCE
Mom and Dad are getting me new gear for the big game. They'll be in any sec, I'm sure they'd love to see this reject in their store.

ISABELLA
I hired him, if they have a problem, they can talk to me.

The store PHONE RINGS in the BG. Isabella leaves to answer it.  Pierce smiles menacingly at Wyatt.

PIERCE
I don't think anyone's going to want to help you, freak, especially after you destroyed the display.

WYATT
What are you talking about --

Pierce SHOVES the display shelf over sending all the expensive helmets SCATTERING on the floor.

WYATT
What the hell?!

PIERCE
Who are they gonna believe, me or the probation poster boy?

WYATT
I think they'll believe me, after I show them this.

Wyatt pulls out a small USB FLASH DRIVE. **FLASHBACK TO:**

.**INT. HUGO'S HOME, LIVING ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)** #44#

Hugo hands Wyatt the flash drive.

HUGO
Donny must've forgot about the shop's security system! Pierce with the branding iron, Donny covering it up -- cameras caught it all.

WYATT
You're the best, man!

**END FLASHBACK.**

.**INT. BRADSHAW'S SPORTING GOODS - CONTINUOUS** #45#

Pierce studies Wyatt, then the flash drive.

PIERCE
What is that supposed to be?

WYATT
Security footage from the shop, showing exactly what happened to my shoulder.

Pierce's eyes widen as he realizes-- *oh shit!*

_**E**_**PISODE 37**

Wyatt smirks seeing Pierce's panic.

WYATT
Should we take a look?

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*SHIT! That video won't just make me look bad, it's incriminating!*

Pierce LUNGES at Wyatt. They SMASH to the ground wrestling for the flash drive. Toppling over the fallen helmets.

Isabella races over.

ISABELLA
Pierce, stop! Get off him!!!

Isabella tries to pull Pierce off, but can't break through the chaos of thrashing fists and clashing helmets.

Suddenly, Krista struts through the front door.

KRISTA
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE!?!

She rushes over and helps Isabella pry Pierce off Wyatt. Pierce manages to rip the flash drive out of Wyatt's hand.

PIERCE
Mom, I told you! He keeps creeping into our lives to fuck everything up!

KRISTA
My husband should've let the cops cart you off back to juvie.

ISABELLA
Mom, I brought him here, just give him a chance!

KRISTA
Isabella, we've talked about this --

WYATT
Mrs. Bradshaw, this time I have proof that Pierce --

Pierce waves the flash drive in Wyatt's face.

PIERCE
You mean this? You're gonna need stronger *"evidence"* than whatever's on this thing to frame me.
(to Krista)
He thinks he can sue us off some false claims.

WYATT
I'm not trying to sue you --

KRISTA
Listen to me, our lawyers are sharks! Whatever tricks and lies are on that drive, they'd tear them apart before they even reach the judge.

PIERCE
I guess no one needs to see this then...

WYATT
No!

**SLOW-MO:** *Wyatt DIVES for the flash drive as Pierce WHIPS the at the ground. But Pierce manages to STOMP it into pieces.*

_**E**_**PISODE 38**

Wyatt looks up at the broken drive with defeat.

PIERCE
You should thank me. I just saved you a lifetime of legal fees.

KRISTA
I'd suggest you clean all this up and get the hell out of our store.

ISABELLA
I'm sorry, Wyatt...

Isabella crouches beside Wyatt, spotting blood dripping from a fresh scrape on his knee through his torn jeans.

ISABELLA
You're bleeding! Stay here, I'll get you a Band-Aid.

Wyatt grabs her arm, and their eyes lock -- then, *like a floodgate bursting,* memories crash over him **FLASHBACK TO:**

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - DAY (FLASHBACK)** #46#

Asher (5) is on the ground hugging his bleeding knee. Isabella (7) runs up to comfort him.

YOUNG ISABELLA
You're bleeding! Stay here, I'll get you a Band-Aid. I won't let anything happen to you.

**CUT TO:** Asher, alone IN THE AISLE, chokes on the smoke. The BUILDING GROANS as the supports weaken.

YOUNG ASHER
(hoarsely)
DAD!

TRENT (O.S.)
(calling out)
ASHERRR!!!

CRACK! Asher looks up as a wooden beam falls. **END FLASHBACK.**

.**INT. BRADSHAW'S SPORTING GOODS - DAY** #47#

Wyatt JOLTS -- *like he's been re-struck by the falling beam.*

ISABELLA
Wyatt, are you okay?

PIERCE
Jesus, he's clearly hopped up on something. A trailer trash druggy.

KRISTA
(to Wyatt)
I want you out of our store, now!

WYATT
(internal voice)
*This is it! This is where I hit my head! Where I lost my family.*

Wyatt scans the faces of Isabella and Krista.

WYATT
(internal voice)
*My sister... my mom... and...*

Trent steps through the front doors.

TRENT
What is everyone--
(spotting Wyatt)
Wyatt?

WYATT
(internal voice)
*Dad! I remember... I remember everything. I'm Asher Bradshaw!*

_**E**_**PISODE 39**

Krista swoops over to Trent's side.

KRISTA
Honey, I thought we were done associating with this delinquent.

TRENT
What happened?

PIERCE
He came in here, trashed the place, and now he's spinning wild accusations to sue us.

ISABELLA
That's not true --

KRISTA
Maybe it's time I talk to the school board.
They'll want to know the kind of liability they're letting walk their halls.

Wyatt stares at his long lost family with disgust.

WYATT
(internal voice)
All these years, these are the people I was supposed to be with? They're no better than Donny!

ISABELLA
He hasn't done anything wrong!

KRISTA
You don't understand how fragile our reputation is, Isabella. I'm just trying to protect our family!

TRENT
Alright! That's enough!

Trent gets down close to Wyatt.

TRENT
Wyatt, ignore them. I just need you to tell me the truth. The other day at the shop --

PIERCE
He's just gonna keep lying --

TRENT
I said enough!
(to Wyatt)
Please, just tell me, did you have a scar on your shoulder?

Wyatt stares deep into Trent's eyes contemplating, he parts his mouth ready to speak.

_**E**_**PISODE 40**

Wyatt lets out a shaky breath.

WYATT
(internal voice)
*I will never be a Bradshaw, if this is the type of family they are...*
(outwardly)
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have a scar.

Isabella and Trent share a defeated look, while Pierce flashes a snaky grin and Krista sighs in relief.

WYATT
I should get going...

Wyatt heaves himself up from the pile of helmets and marches towards the exit. Trent stops him.

TRENT
Wyatt, wait. Scar or not, we could still use you on the team.

PIERCE
What! After everything he's done!

TRENT
I was an idiot kicking you off.
You're one of our best players --

KRISTA
Trent, I said I don't want him around our family, think about it!

TRENT
I have.
(to Wyatt)
What do you say, kid?

Wyatt shakes his head "no," and shrugs Trent off.

WYATT
They're right, it's better for all of us if I stay away. I've met kinder people in juvie than this fucked up family.

Wyatt catches eyes with Isabella, who's hurt and near tears. He snaps to Trent and feigns confidence.

WYATT
Do me a favor, and leave me alone.

Wyatt leaves. Trent tries to catch up, but Krista grabs him.

KRISTA
It's over, Trent, let him go.

TRENT
I just thought, maybe it was him--

KRISTA
Honey, Asher could still be out there, but you should be relieved he's not this felon, destined for a life behind bars. That's not the Bradshaw way.

Trent stares off at the door where Wyatt left. Behind him, Isabella begins picking up the helmets hiding her tears, while Pierce radiates victory -- *he won.*

_**E**_**PISODE 41**

.**INT. HUGO'S HOME, LIVING ROOM - DAY** #48#

Wyatt and Hugo, sitting on the couch with football playing in the background, CLINK beer bottles.

HUGO
A fucking Bradshaw! Shit, I knew your football skills didn't come from Donny. What'd they say when you told them?

WYATT
I didn't.
(seeing Hugo's expression)
What? They're elitist assholes, I don't want anything to do with them.

HUGO
What about football?

WYATT
Fuck football. I'll just hangout with you the rest of my life.

HUGO
I'm only saying this 'cuz I love you like a brother, but fuck you!
You have the opportunity of a lifetime, but you're too much of a pussy to grab it by the balls.

WYATT
That family's put me through hell!

HUGO
You know why I sweat my ass off chopping wood all day? Because I don't have a choice. Most of us don't.
That'll be the rest of my life, just back-breaking work, a couple rug rats running around, and a miserable broad in the kitchen. The highlight of my week will be cracking a beer and watching the game every Sunday... But, you know what would make all that worth it?
(beat)
If one day I can turn on that TV and see you hit the fields, and I can say, "hey, I knew that guy."

After a moment of thick silence, Hugo stands up.

HUGO
Most of us don't have a choice, dude. But you do. I'll get you another beer.

Wyatt stares off in the distance in contemplation.

.**INT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP, ROOM - DAY** #49#

Off to the side, Donny scratches his head staring at Pierce.

DONNY
If Wyatt said he'd stay away then why do you wanna go after him?

PIERCE
As long as he's still out there, he's a threat. Don't you wanna see me in NFL?

DONNY
Of course! What do you need me to do?

PIERCE
Make it so he can never pick up a ball again.

DONNY
I know just the guys.

_**E**_**PISODE 42**

.**EXT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY** #50#

Drenched in sweat, the football players drag themselves off the field. A few fist bump Wyatt as they pass -- he stands tall and barely winded.

TRENT
Hit the showers, fellas.  No pit stink -- Wyatt, are you coming?

WYATT
I'm gonna stay out here a bit longer and practice.

TRENT
(nods, slowly)
I used to be the same, first on, last off.

Trent eyes Wyatt. *Could he truly be his son?*  In turmoil, Trent watches Wyatt jog to the center of the field, then heads into the locker room, deep in thought.

ANGLE ON Pierce watching from the sidelines, gritting his teeth. He HUFFS and creeps off behind the bleachers.

Wyatt starts practicing a 5-step-drop when, suddenly, he backs into 3 THUGS (30s), all tatted, masked, and muscular.

THUG 1
Look what we've got here.

Just then, Thug 1 SOCKS Wyatt right in the jaw, sending him CRASHING to the ground!

_**E**_**PISODE 43**

Wyatt's head swivels, trying to keep track of each thug.

WYATT
Who the fuck are you guys?

THUG 1
We're about to be the last thing you ever see, pretty boy.

Thug 2 kicks Wyatt in the ribs.

THUG 2
Stand up, pussy, you're supposed to be a big shot quarterback, right?

Thug 3 grabs Wyatt and rips him off the ground. He holds him up, arms pinned behind his back.

Thug 3 pushes Wyatt, who stumbles into the center of the circle. Wyatt clenches his fist, bracing for an attack.

ON THE SIDELINES**,** Isabella picks up pom-poms from practice. She glances over to the SHOUTS coming from the field. Her eyes widen at the sight of Wyatt being beaten to a pulp.

ISABELLA
(in shock)
Oh my god... Wyatt!!!

She drops the pom-poms and rushes off.

.**INT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, LOCKER ROOM - DAY** #51#

Trent walks through the locker room when his CELL RINGS. CALLER ID: Detective Stratford. He answers it anxiously.

LEAD DETECTIVE (OVER CELL)
Sir, I ran the DNA labs off the hair sample you gave me. It's a match. Wyatt Lewis is your long lost son. He is Asher Bradshaw.

Trent hangs up, plops onto a bench, unable to stand.

TRENT
It's him... after all this time...
(tears falling)
My boy... my son...What have I done?

Trent looks at his SCREENSAVER: it's a photo from the grand opening of his store. He stands with Krista, Isabella, and Asher -- *a smiling happy family.*

TRENT
(vowing to Asher in photo) I'm going to make it up to you.
You're coming home, Son. You're coming home.

Suddenly, the door is thrown open by Isabella.

ISABELLA
DAD, HELP! WYATT'S BEING ATTACKED ON THE FIELD!

_**E**_**PISODE 44**

.**EXT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY** #52#

Wyatt kicks -- Thug 2 and Thug 3 hit the ground, hard.

Blood streaks his split lip, but Wyatt stands tall. Chest heaving. Eyes locked and lethal.

Suddenly, Thug 1 pulls out a SWITCHBLADE, catching the light.

THUG 1
Let's end this.
(to Thug 2 & 3)
GRAB HIM!

Thug 2 & 3 haul themselves up, they RUSH Wyatt.  THUG 2 grabs his left arm. THUG 3 wrestles his right. Thug 1 closes in, blade trailing along Wyatt's arm.

THUG 1
Tough guy, huh? But tough guys still bleed.

Thug 1 SWINGS the knife, but Wyatt DODGES. The blade misses his neck, slicing his arm. Blood drips down his bicep.

WYATT
You're not walking away from this.

THUG 1
Neither are you, pretty boy.

Thug 1 RAISES the blade for a kill shot -- Wyatt twists, using the momentum of Thug 2 & 3 pinning him, and DRIVES his elbow into Thug 1's ribs!  We hear a sickening CRACK (**SFX**).

THUG 1
MOTHERFUCKER!

Thug 1 STUMBLES, but he's not done. He LUNGES again, knife flashing!  Wyatt GRITS HIS TEETH. Blood streaks his arm. Eyes closed, he braces for the worst...

Then, out of nowhere -- A FIST FLIES! It's TRENT!

TRENT
GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF HIM!

Thug 1's head snaps back. He spins just in time to receive a BONE-CRUNCHING punch by a furious Trent. Thug 1 collapses to the ground.

WYATT
Trent!

Thug 2 & 3 jump up, leaving Wyatt on the grass. It's a standoff between everyone.  Trent locks eyes on the thugs.

TRENT
(grim)
Son, get out of here...

Wyatt pulls himself to his feet, fists ready.

WYATT
Not happening.

TRENT
I said, go!

WYATT
You're not fighting this alone, old man.

Trent's gaze lingers on Wyatt. PRIDE flickers in his eyes.

TRENT
Alright, kid. Let's finish this.

They move in sync. Wyatt ducks, Trent swings. Trent pins Thug 2, Wyatt finishes him off. Trent traps Thug 3's arm. Wyatt drives a punch. A seamless rhythm between father and son.

Then suddenly in SLOW-MO: *Thug 1 appears behind Trent, swings his BLADE STRAIGHT FOR TRENT! Wyatt's heart stops.  He LUNGES -- but is too far.  The blade SINKS deep into Trent's flesh!*

WYATT
NOOOO!!!  DAD!!!

_**E**_**PISODE 45**

Trent rips the knife out of his shoulder and SMASHES the handle of the blade into Thug 1's temple, knocking him out cold. The other thugs stagger back timidly.

TRENT
WHO'S NEXT! COME AT ME!

The thugs trip over themselves backing away, before hauling off the field in a full sprint. Trent sways, and Wyatt comes to his side steadying him.

WYATT
Let's get out of here.
(shouting across the field)
ISABELLA, CALL 911!

TRENT
I heard what you called me back there.

WYATT
It... It doesn't matter, we need to get you help!

**ON THE SIDELINES,** Isabella turns away from the field, choking back tears. She holds her CELL up, hand trembling.

ISABELLA
We need an ambulance out at Riverstone's football field, now!... \*someone's been stabbed, just hurry!!!

.**INT. HOSPITAL, VIP ROOM - LATER SAME DAY** #53#

The Doctor frowns down at a bruised and battered Wyatt.

DOCTOR
I'm sorry to see you back in my hospital so soon, young man.
(shakes his head)
And you.

The Doctor turns to Trent, a Nurse cleaning his wound.

DOCTOR
You're old enough to know better not to get into a fight, Mr. Bradshaw.

TRENT
They had it coming.
(smirks at Wyatt)
You see that son of a bitch hit the ground? Folded like a rag doll.

WYATT
Yeah, they were pretty tough... for like 5 seconds. They did get in a decent slice in though.

He gestures to Trent's wound.

TRENT
*Decent*? Kid, I'm damn near held up with duck tape!

Wyatt almost laughs, catches himself, snorts instead.

WYATT
I guess you held your own, old man.

ANGLE ON Pierce lingering outside the room, watching in fury as Trent and Wyatt COMPARE INJURIES LIKE BATTLE SCARS.

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*That fucking moron, Donny, said he'd handle it. All those thugs did was bring them closer together.*

DOWN THE HALL, Isabella hurries over with Krista.

KRISTA
Where is my husband!?! Where's Trent!?!

They pass Pierce and enter the room, he follows on their heels.

_**E**_**PISODE 46**

.**INT. HOSPITAL, VIP ROOM - CONTINUOUS** #54#

Krista runs over to Trent's side.

KRISTA
Honey!!! Are you okay?

TRENT
I'm fine--

KRISTA
Oh god, who did this to you?
(spotting Wyatt)
Was it you, you dirty hoodlum --

TRENT
Krista, no! He stuck by my side. I don't know if I'd have been able to kick their asses without him.

PIERCE
(bitterly)
Isn't that nice.

ISABELLA
Are you okay, Wyatt?

WYATT
I'm fine... But, I should go, and let you all have your family time.

Wyatt strains to get out of bed.

TRENT
No, sit down.

KRISTA
He said he wants to go, Trent.

TRENT
Yeah, for family time. And that's exactly what this is.
(smiling at Wyatt)
It's time you all know... Wyatt... he's our son.

_**E**_**PISODE 47**

Krista's jaw drops and tears well in Isabella's eyes. Pierce remains unfazed, cold and calculating. The room falls thick with silence as everyone looks at Wyatt.

KRISTA
...what...

TRENT
This young man is Asher Bradshaw.

The tension breaks as Isabella wraps Wyatt into a big hug.

ISABELLA
Oh god... Oh god! It is you! I never thought I'd see you again!

KRISTA
No... no, he can't be...

Trent pulls out the printed labs and passes them to Krista.

TRENT
I had the hospital print out the lab reports when I got here.

KRISTA
(reading)
"Based on the DNA analysis, the Wyatt Lewis is the biological son of Trent... and Krista Bradshaw...

Krista's voice and body is shaking.

KRISTA
I don't understand.

TRENT
It's our boy, Krista, it's Asher.

Krista looks at Wyatt, her entire world shattering.

KRISTA
But I'm his mother...I would have known...this has to be another con...I would have known if he was my blood!

\*WYATT
  
(tight)
Look, lady, I don't want to be your son anymore than you want to be my mother.

KRISTA
(breaking)
Oh my god, what have I done?

_**E**_**PISODE 48**

Krista collapses, Trent managing to catch her with his good arm as she sobs in his arms.

KRISTA
I didn't know...my baby boy...I thought he was dead...I stopped hoping..I gave up...

TRENT
He's alive, sweetheart, he's right here with us.

Krista turns to look at a stiff and uncomfortable Wyatt.

KRISTA
I was awful to you, Asher. I don't know if you can ever forgive me, I know I won't forgive myself.  But I'll find a way to make it up to you.

Pierce watches his situation go from bad to worse.

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*This is it, it's only a matter of time before they throw me out... I just have to play it cool until I can finish the job.*
(outwardly)
That's... *just great.*

Trent looks from Krista to Wyatt, who has his arms crossed.

TRENT
I know things have been rocky between the two of you, but I want to find some common ground since he'll be staying with us.

WYATT
Staying with you?

TRENT
Of course. I figured you'd want to come home, after all these years?

KRISTA
(eager, hopeful)
Your old room is just as you left it...

ISABELLA
You are coming home, aren't you?

WYATT
I... I don't...

_**E**_**PISODE 49**

Wyatt scans the room, feeling everyone's piercing stares.

WYATT
(internal voice)
Screw them! They treated me like shit for weeks! It's just because because I share their blood that they suddenly give a shit about me!

TRENT
Asher, please, we want you home.

WYATT
Fuck no.

ISABELLA
What? But, you're our family...

Wyatt gets out of bed, looking down on the Bradshaw.

WYATT
I thought I was just a filthy convict. A few weeks ago you were ready to let the cops haul me off --

KRISTA
Asher, it was all a horrible mistake! We were just trying to protect the Bradshaw name. It's difficult being in the public eye, and we've had con artists try to take advantage of us in the past.

TRENT
We messed up, Asher --

WYATT
Stop calling me that!

ISABELLA
But we've been looking for you for twelve years!

WYATT
Yeah? Well, a lot changed during that time. And not just with me.

WYATT TURNS TO THE DOOR AND IS MET WITH PIERCE'S SMUG FACE.

PIERCE
It's a shame, I always wanted a brother...
(only for Wyatt to hear)
But you'd probably be more comfortable in a holding cell.

Wyatt swerves past Pierce, SLAMMING the hospital door.

_**E**_**PISODE 50**

.**EXT. HUGO'S APARTMENT - DAY** #55#

Trent hesitates, then KNOCKS on the door. After a moment, it

\*opens with Wyatt on the other side, who frowns at Trent.

WYATT
What are you doing here?

TRENT
I just wanted another chance to apologize for everything.

WYATT
I don't want another apology, I want to go our separate ways.

TRENT
I know, but I've been raking my brain on how to make things right --

Trent throws Wyatt a set of keys, he reflexively catches it.

WYATT
What's this?

TRENT
Well, I was thinking of how I missed so many moments of your life.

TRENT
Going camping and catching your first fish, teaching you to shave, your first crush and the sex talk... so I thought, maybe I could get you your first car.

Trent steps aside and motions to a shiny new Lamborghini in

\*the driveway! Wyatt's eyes bug out.  So do Hugo's, behind him.

HUGO
Holy shit, Wyatt. That's a frickin' Lambo! It's worth like two hundred thousand dollars.

TRENT
More like three fifty thousand.
(looks at Wyatt)
Do you like it, son?

Wyatt stares at the car, it's a dream car! Then he shuts it down, his face going blank.

WYATT
There's some other firsts you missed, Bradshaw.
(hard)
You missed years of me getting my ass kicked by the man I thought was my father. You missed me dumpster diving for my next meal because he was too drunk or too broke to buy groceries. You missed him forcing me to take the fall for him and rotting behind bars.

Trent pales.

TRENT
He... He did what?

WYATT
Forget it, you can't buy me back.

TRENT
No, of course not. I just wanted to make a gesture... I'm sorry, I'll get going...

Wyatt holds out the car keys.  Trent shakes his head, walks away, climbing into a BLACK LAND ROVER, Isabella watching sadly from the driver's seat.

As they drive off, Hugo looks at Wyatt, then the keys.

WYATT
Don't even think about it, I'm not keeping that thing.

HUGO
Doesn't mean you can't test it...

Hugo elbows him with a grin. Wyatt rolls his eyes and jingles the keys, to Hugo's excitement. They smirk at each other.

**FLASH CUTS:** Chrome rims spinning. The golden emblem gleaming. The sleek hood glints under the sun. Wyatt and Hugo drop into the leather seats.

HUGO
Now, this is the life!

They CRANK UP SOME MUSIC and REV THE ENGINE. They peel out of the driveway, TIRES SQUEALING.

_**E**_**PISODE 51**

.**EXT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP, ROOM - DAY** #56#

Donny leans against the worktable as Pierce paces in front of him -- *furious*.

PIERCE
It's all falling apart!!!

DONNY
We can hire some more muscle to rough Asher up --

PIERCE
That's not good enough! The Bradshaws won't stop until he comes home. We have to stop them before that happens or it's game over for me!

Donny straightens, suddenly tense. Pierce follows his gaze to see Trent standing stoic, arms crossed, IN THE DOORWAY.

PIERCE
Dad...
(internal voice)
*Shit! How long has he been there?*

Trent eyes Pierce suspiciously.

TRENT
Pierce? What are you doing here?

PIERCE
I was seeing if Donny had any advice on how we can get through to Asher, since he raised him --

TRENT
*Raised*... that fucker abused him!

DONNY
What? Mr. Bradshaw I would never. I took him in when he had no one.

Trent pins Donny up against the worktable.

TRENT
He had us!

DONNY
Had I known he was a Bradshaw, of course I would've returned him, I'm your number one fan, see --

Donny brandishes his **#14 wrist tattoo** and Trent frowns as he's brought back to that day **FLASHBACK TO:**

INT. HOSPITAL, ROOM 300 - DAY (**FLASHBACK**) #57#

Trent springs into the room, spots Donny.

TRENT
Have you seen my son --

DONNY
No, Mr. Bradshaw, it's just me.

Donny shifts awkwardly in front of the bed.

TRENT
What are you hiding?

Trent rips back the curtain revealing an empty bed.

DONNY
I would never lie to you, Mr. Bradshaw, I'm your number one fan! I even got your number inked!

**END FLASHBACK.**

.**EXT. LEWIS HANDYMAN SHOP - CONTINUOUS** #58#

Trent's grip tightens and Donny GROANS in pain.

TRENT
It was you! 12 years ago! You were at the hospital... *you* took my son!

_**E**_**PISODE 52**

Donny quivers under Trent's grip.

DONNY
Mr. Bradshaw, you have it all wrong --

Trent PUNCHES Donny's face, sending him to the sawdust covered ground with a painful THUD.

TRENT
Why did you take him? ANSWER ME!

DONNY
I was trying to give him a home --

Trent kicks Donny in the stomach, he keels over COUGHING.

TRENT
You didn't give him a fucking home, you tortured him!

DONNY
He was a troubled kid.

TRENT
If you lie to me again I'll smash your fucking skull in!

DONNY
You're a father... Please! You have to understand, I -- I was just looking out for my son!!!

The truth comes out like vomit, and Donny glances over to Pierce. Trent follows his gaze and steps back in shock.

TRENT
Your *son*...

PIERCE
No!  I don't know what he's talking about, he's crazy --

TRENT
All this time...

Donny grovels at Trent's feet pathetically.

DONNY
Don't take this out on Pierce. You raised him all these years --

TRENT
GET OFF ME! If I ever see you near my family again, I'll kill you!

Trent storms off down the hallway, Pierce swoops in on Donny.

PIERCE
What the fuck!!!

DONNY
I'm sorry, I panicked! I didn't --

PIERCE
If you don't fix this, I'll make sure you're locked up in a prison without a pot to piss in. Got it?!?

Donny nervously nods "yes" as Pierce runs off after Trent.

_**E**_**PISODE 53**

.**INT. BRADSHAW MANSION, ENTRYWAY - DAY** #59#

Pierce slips inside and freezes. Trent blocks his path with Pierce's suitcase in hand -- packed and ready. He meets Trent's ice-cold gaze.

PIERCE
DAD! Please, let's talk about this.

TRENT
Don't call me that! Your blood kidnapped my real son, you're just an imposter!

Trent lifts the suitcase, aiming to shove it at Pierce, but Krista swoops in, snatching it from Trent.

KRISTA
Trent! Pierce was just a child himself! He's a victim in this too... He's still our son. Just as much as Asher.

PIERCE
Please, I promise, I didn't have anything to do with it. I just wanted to help bring Asher home.

Trent works through a stiff SIGH.

TRENT
If I find out you're lying, you're gonna hit the streets with nothing but the shirt on your back.

Trent stomps into the mansion. Krista hugs Pierce tenderly.

KRISTA
Give him time, he'll come around. I didn't protect Asher, but I can protect you.

.**INT. HUGO'S HOME, LIVING ROOM - DAY** #60#

Hugo leans over the couch, where Wyatt is taking a nap, SNORING and plugs his nose.  Wyatt chokes awake.

HUGO
(laughing)
Yo, get your ass up.

WYATT
What the hell?

HUGO
We gotta bounce, dude, I got a surprise for you.

Wyatt GROANS and slinks off the couch.

_**E**_**PISODE 54**

.**EXT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY** #61#

Hugo has Wyatt blindfolded as they step out onto the field.

WYATT
Come one, man, where are you taking me? I'm not in the mood for games.

HUGO
No? Not even football?

Hugo lifts Wyatt's blindfold, revealing the THREE PLAYERS for the LA GOLDEN KNIGHTS standing heroically on the field.

WYATT
Oh my god...

Hugo is ecstatic, jumping and jostling Wyatt.

HUGO
I KNOW, DUDE, THIS IS AWESOME!!!

BRADY SPIELMAN (30s) steps out from the group.

BRADY
You must be Asher. We heard you've got a pretty good arm on you, and wanted to know if you'd toss the pigskin around with us.

WYATT
How did you know...

The Golden Knights part, revealing Trent standing behind them proudly. He tosses a ball over to Wyatt.

TRENT
What do you say, kid?

Wyatt immediately rolls his eyes at Hugo.

HUGO
He means well... And it's the fucking LA GOLDEN KNIGHTS!!!

Wyatt sighs and CHUCKS the ball back to Trent.

WYATT
Fine, but only if you can keep up.

The players LAUGH and take to the field.

_E_PISODE 55

IN THE DISTANCE: Pierce strolls past the field, glancing over and freezing at the sight of the LA Golden Knights. Then he spots Trent laughing with Wyatt -- *the real father and son.*

PIERCE
(internal voice)
*"Nothing's changed," huh? As long as that shit lives, I'm nothing to Trent but a second-string son...*

Pierce grits his teeth and marches off.

**ON THE FIELD**

Wyatt WHIPS the football at Brady, who shakes his stinging hands, and looks to Trent.

BRADY
Damn, you weren't kidding. I think he can throw better than you.

TRENT
Yeah, well, he's my son.

Trent watches Wyatt emotionally as he hustles over to the group.

BRADY
Tight workout there, keep it up and you'll be better than half these posers by college.

WYATT
Thanks, Brady!

LA Golden Knights file off the field. Wyatt looks over, amused to see Hugo coaxing the NFL players into autographs and selfies. From behind, Trent, CLEARS his THROAT.

TRENT
They're serious, you know. You got the chops, Son.

Wyatt turns to Trent, realizing they're now alone.

TRENT
I could stand here and beg you to come home, but if you won't do that, at least come play tomorrow.

WYATT
I don't know... Every time I'm around you guys, my life implodes.

TRENT
I'll talk to Pierce --

WYATT
He's part of the problem. But so is Krista, and so are you. I just don't know if I'm ready for this.

TRENT
I can't apologize enough --

WYATT
So stop. And stop showering me in gifts, it's not going to undue what happened. I appreciate this, but I told you, I'm not a Bradshaw.

Wyatt trudges off and Trent watches in deep remorse.

_**E**_**PISODE 56**

.**INT. DONNY'S HOME, LIVING ROOM - DAY** #62#

Donny is on the ground cowering before Pierce.

PIERCE
You said you would do anything for me! You swore it!

DONNY
I -- I will, but I can't do that! I thought we were just crippling him, not... not *this*!

Pierce yanks up Donny by his vest, inches from his face.

PIERCE
Trent won't stop begging him to come back until Asher's dead!

DONNY
... I have a gun under my pillow... But I won't be the one to pull the trigger! I can't...

Pierce hurls Donny down, his HEAD SLAMS against the floor with a THUD. Pierce storms out. Seconds later, he RETURNS with GUN IN HAND. He looks at his real father with pure disgust.

PIERCE
You're pathetic.

Pierce barges out of the trailer.

.**EXT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, FOOTBALL FIELD - DUSK** #63#

Isabella walks over to Wyatt with something behind her back.

WYATT
Hey, now's not a great time --

ISABELLA
Look, ever since you were taken from us, our parents have never been the same. Dad became intensely overprotective, and mom's been consumed with the image of a perfect family to distract herself from the one she lost.

WYATT
That doesn't make it okay.

ISABELLA
It doesn't... but, for the first time, I saw a glimmer of hope in them, when they found out you were still alive. And I felt it too.

Isabella unveils the luxury helmet from the store.

ISABELLA 
Dad said you weren't going to play, but I hope you'll change your mind. I'd really like to cheer for my little brother tomorrow.

Isabella hands him the helmet and slips off. Wyatt looks down, catching his own reflection in the shiny helmet.

_**E**_**PISODE 57**

.**INT. BRADSHAW MANSION, DINNING ROOM - DAY** #64#

Trent, Isabella, and Krista are around the table eating breakfast -- *a lively spirit amongst them.* Pierce enters in a black hoodie and sweats.

TRENT
Big game today, how you feeling, Pierce?

KRISTA
Honey, go put on the new gear we got you, I want a picture!

PIERCE
I'm not going.

ISABELLA
What? It's the last home game of the season --

PIERCE
I know. But I also know you want Asher out on the field, and he's not gonna play if I'm there.

TRENT
I don't want another fight --

PIERCE
I'm not. Maybe next season we can play together, as brothers. But tonight, it should be all about him.

TRENT
That's big of you, son.

Krista squeezes Pierce's arm affectionately.

KRISTA
I'm so proud of you!

Pierce looks over the Bradshaws with a forced smile and joins them for breakfast, plopping his backpack down by his legs.

**CLOSE UP** on Donny's pistol, gleaming inside the backpack.

.**EXT. HUGO'S HOME - DAY** #65#

\*Wyatt, fully suited in his football gear, swings the door open to head off to the game. He recoils at the sight of Donny, battered and crazed, waiting for him on the doorsteps.

DONNY
There he is!

_**E**_**PISODE 58**

Wyatt glowers at Donny with disgust, slamming the door.

WYATT
Get away from me!

Donny grabs the door.

DONNY
Asher! You have to listen to me... You can't go to that game.

WYATT
You don't get a say in what I do anymore. You're nothing to me.

DONNY
I know you're angry --

WYATT
*Angry?!?* You broke me down, day after day. Ruined my record. And sicced your psychotic son on me!

DONNY
I just wanted Pierce to have the life I could never give him.

WYATT
Well, you got what you wanted, he was raised by the Bradshaws. He had EVERYTHING. I had NOTHING.  Yet I'm still a better player than him. Now get the fuck out of my way.

Wyatt shoves past Donny, and struts off down the driveway.

_**E**_**PISODE 59**

.**EXT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT** #66#

Trent is in a huddle with the Riverstone High Football Players and the Assistant Coach. The ROAR of the CROWD and the HIGH SCHOOL BAND can be HEARD behind them.

TRENT
I know we're missing our star quarterback but --

TYLER
Coach, look!

**SLOW-MO:** *Wyatt strides onto the field in crisp, high-end gear, every step electric. He swings his gleaming helmet in the air, plopping it on his head. Trent watches with pride.*

Wyatt gets into the huddle, his teammates welcoming him with

\*open arms. Wyatt and Trent lock eyes with a content smile.

WYATT
Sorry I'm late, Coach.

TRENT
You're just in time, Quarterback.
Alright, we're opening in spread, four-wide, keep 'em on their heels. Got it!

ALL PLAYERS
YES, COACH!

**BY THE BLEACHERS**

Pierce emerges from the shadows, hood low, eyes locked on the field. He clenches his jaw, fingers tightening around the pistol in his pocket.

The WHISTLE BLOWS marking the start of the game.

_**E**_**PISODE 60**

An ANNOUNCER's VOICE competes with the ROAR of the CROWD.

**OVER SERIES SHOTS:** The football players hoist Wyatt in the air victoriously. Isabella CHEERS with the other Cheerleaders. Trent and Assistant Coach high five.

ANNOUNCER (OVER PA SYSTEM)
AND THAT'S A TOUCHDOWN BY WYATT LEWIS, ENDING THE GAME AT 49-7, A MASSIVE BLOW OUT AND HISTORIC WIN FOR RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL!

Trent runs up to Wyatt and wraps him in a bear hug.

TRENT
That was incredible!!! God, you made me so proud out there.

WYATT
I've never felt like this before!

TRENT
Yeah, well get used to it! Come, I got someone waiting for you in the locker room.

Trent and Wyatt head off to the locker room.

**ON THE BLEACHERS**

Krista is on her feet CHEERING with the crowd. She looks out at Wyatt and breaks into a smile.

KRISTA
That's my son... THAT'S MY SON!

She glances over and spots Pierce as he sneaks his way back around the bleachers.

KRISTA
  
(internal voice)
\*Pierce? I thought he wasn't
coming... Whatever he's doing, he can't mess this up for Asher.\*

Krista follows, with a look of unease.

_**E**_**PISODE 61**

.**INT. RIVERSTONE HIGH SCHOOL, LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT** #67#

Trent leads Wyatt into the locker room where college scout, JASON BROWN (50s), in a suit and tie waits for him.

SCOUT BROWN
There he is! God, what a play!

Jason shakes Wyatt's hand vigorously.

SCOUT BROWN
I'm Jason Brown, head scout for University of Michigan...

TRENT
My alma mater.

SCOUT BROWN
That's right! I scouted Trent when he was 16. My first big success.
So when he told me he had a boy that could rival his legacy, I knew I had to come on out and see.

TRENT
And, was I wrong? He's got an arm --

SCOUT BROWN
He's got more than an arm! He's got the whole damn package.

WYATT
Thank you, sir!

SCOUT BROWN
Don't thank me.
(pointing to Trent)
That man blessed you with the genetics of a god. When I saw you out there I knew it, I said that kid's a Bradshaw.

Wyatt's face falters.

SCOUT BROWN
So what do you say to hitting the field up north after graduation to carry on your old man's legacy?

WYATT
(internal thought)
*Continue on _h_is legacy. That's all this ever is...*

Wyatt pats Wyatt's shoulder.

TRENT
Well?

_**E**_**PISODE 62**

Wyatt looks between Scout Brown and Trent.

WYATT
I'm sorry, I can't.

TRENT
(to Scout Brown)
Could you give us a moment.

SCOUT BROWN
Sure.
(handing Wyatt his card)
If you change your mind, make sure to give me a call.

Scout Brown waltzes out of the locker room.

TRENT
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Michigan is one of the top schools --

WYATT
It's your school. All of this is to continue on the Bradshaw legacy you're all so obsessed with!

TRENT
I couldn't care less about my legacy, this is for you! You earned this... But, I'll take the hint and leave you alone. I'm sorry, son, I really am.

Trent retreats from the room, shoulders heavy. Wyatt turns, catching his reflection in the polished curve of his helmet.

WYATT
(internal voice)
*Am I making a mistake...*

Suddenly, he HEARS the DOOR OPEN again.

WYATT
Trent, I --

Wyatt turns and stumbles back at the sight of -- Pierce standing in the doorway, his eyes gleam with crazed fury.

WYATT
Pierce...

_**E**_**PISODE 63**

Pierce takes heavy steps towards Wyatt with rapid breath.

WYATT
What are you doing here?

PIERCE
Just congratulating my *brother* after the big game...

WYATT
I'm not your brother.

PIERCE
I know... You're a Bradshaw, it feels good to be on top, right?

WYATT
Just leave me alone, dude --

PIERCE
It's not fair! I spent the last 12 years busting my ass, and just because of some FUCKING genetics, everything is being handed to you, while I'm tossed aside! I've tried every way to get you out of my life! So, this is really on you...

Pierce pulls out the gun. Wyatt goes stiff.

_**E**_**PISODE 64**

Wyatt backs away until his shoulders SLAM into the lockers.

WYATT
Don't do this, Pierce. We can just go our separate ways --

PIERCE
There is no separate ways. Like it or not, we'll always be pitted against each other, so one of us has to go, *brother*...

Pierce raises the gun at Wyatt.

Wyatt POV: Barrel aimed straight at him. Pierce's eyes are dead cold. His finger on the trigger!

PIERCE
They won't stop until you're dead.

**SLOW-MO:** *Pierce takes aim and COCKS the gun. Wyatt recoils, with nowhere else to go. Just as Pierce is about to pull the trigger, Krista bursts through the locker room door.*

KRISTA
SON!

**SLOW-MO:**  *Krista jumps in front of the gun just as Pierce pulls the trigger -- BANG!*

A wounded Krista collapses to the ground. Isabella and Trent rush inside. Isabella and Wyatt fall at their mother's side while Trent wrestles Pierce to the ground.

Wyatt squeezes Krista's hand. Blood pools out of the bullet wound in her shoulder.  His eyes fill with tears.

WYATT
Why did you do that?

Krista raises a bloody hand to cup Wyatt's cheek.

KRISTA
You're my son.

Krista closes her eyes, the pain making her gasp.

ISABELLA
Mom, please! Stay with us!

Trent gets Pierce pinned, the gun far out of reach.

PIERCE
GET OFF ME! GET OFF!!!

TRENT
SOMEONE CALL 911!

Isabella springs up and dials her CELL, pacing in the background. Krista reaches up and caresses Wyatt's face.

KRISTA
I'm so sorry...

WYATT
Shhh. It's okay, look at me, please!!!  Please... Mom...

KRISTA
(gasping, teary eyed)
It was worth it...to hear you... call me mom.

Krista's eyes flutter, her breaths shallow. The SIRENS wail in the distance. 

>**FADE TO BLACK.**

_E_PISODE 65

.**INT. HOSPITAL, ROOM 300 - DAY** #68#

Krista stirs awake in a hospital bed, her shoulder bandaged. Trent and Isabella sit at her side with their heads down, patiently waiting. Isabella looks up, drying her tears.

ISABELLA
Mom!

KRISTA
Tell me I look better than I feel.

Trent CHUCKLES, gently rubbing her forehead.

TRENT
You look like a million bucks.

Krista's eyes fill with hope and fear.

KRISTA
Asher, is he okay --

Just then, there's a soft knock on the door and Wyatt enters. He's awkwardly holding flowers.

WYATT
The doctor said you were going to make a full recovery.

Krista's eyes are locked tearfully on the flowers.

KRISTA
Are those...for me?

WYATT
Yeah. You took a bullet meant for me. It's the least I could do.

He clumsily hands them to her.

KRISTA
I'm your mother, I'd take a hundred bullets for you. But I like the flowers.

Wyatt watches her sniff them, shifting uncomfortably.

WYATT
That's good... and Pierce?

TRENT
Pierce is facing trial for attempted murder. He'll be in juvie until he's of age -- then off to prison with his father.

ISABELLA
They'll both pay for what they did.

TRENT
And I have the lawyers involved to scrub your record clean.

WYATT
Really? Thank you. I guess everything worked out then...
(nervously)
Um... Listen, I have something I wanted to say...

_**E**_**PISODE 66**

Wyatt steps further into the room.

WYATT
You've all gone lengths to make things right --

TRENT
I already told them, we'd back off.

WYATT
No! That's not it... I just wanted to say that I appreciate everything you've all done. We can't undo the past 12 years.

ISABELLA
Asher, please --

KRISTA
Just let him talk, honey.

WYATT
I've gone most of my life feeling like I was on my own. But you all have shown me what it's like to be loved, protected, and believed in... And I'd like to be a part of that... if you'll have me.

Trent, misty eyed, pulls Wyatt into a hug.

TRENT
You're our son, Asher Bradshaw, we're here for you no matter what.

Isabella breaks down into tears and joins.

ISABELLA
I've waited so long for this!

Krista reaches out with trembling hands and tearful smile.

KRISTA
Come on, get over here! All of you!

Trent and Isabella rope Wyatt into a hug with Krista.

KRISTA
I've never been more proud of our family! Nothing's ever going to come between us again.

The happy family continues to hug around the hospital bed.

_**E**_**PISODE 67**

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - DAY** #69#

**SUPER: ONE MONTH LATER**

The store is once again decorated and buzzing with a small crowd. Trent speaks into a microphone before reporters.

TRENT
I can honestly say, this is the proudest moment in my career. I'd like to welcome my son... Asher Bradshaw.

Wyatt, _n_ow formally taking his birth name _**A**_**SHER BRADSHAW,** steps beside his father in a fancy suit.

WYATT
Thank you. As many of you know, I was torn from my family years ago.

Wyatt spots Krista, Isabella, and Hugo, all smiling at him.

WYATT
It's hard to even think about college when I'm making up for lost time. But it's also an honor to officially announce I'll be continuing on my father's legacy, as a Wolverine at the University o

The crowd erupts in a thunderous APPLAUSE.

.**INT. JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER, HOLDING CELL - AT THAT MOMENT** #70#

Pierce, bruised and dirty in an **orange jumpsuit**, WATCHES THE BROADCAST from the HOLDING CELL TV.

PIERCE
NO! NO! NO! THAT SHOULD BE ME!

He springs up, ready to fight the TV.

PIERCE
THAT SHOULD BE ME!!!

.**INT. BRADSHAW SPORTING GOODS - CONTINUOUS** #71#

Wyatt looks over to his family, eyes filling with love.

WYATT
My father once stood in this very spot and said "I know the importance of family, whether on the field or at home," and I'm proud to have finally found mine.

Krista, Isabella, Hugo, and Trent join him on stage. A camera FLASHES capturing the joyful moment of a happy family.
